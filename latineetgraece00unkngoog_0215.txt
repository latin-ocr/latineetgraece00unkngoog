Oontent to shore the burden oi thy orown

And nll the mournful splendore of thy state-
BondIng my doner-like benuty to thy wilt,
Seeking with light thy lonely dtrk to fid

Wondoring, I think how thy deor love heth bound me
In o now life thet half forgeto the old;

All doy 1 haunt the meodows where you found me,
Rode-deep in dnffodils of dueky gold,

Or sit beside Gynne's fountnin, dreoming

of the red lake hy thy derk polede gleeming.

'l'he dneedlul gorge, through which l drot deeoended
To thy dnrk world, seems like yon stormy sky,

'l'hrough whose derk thunderlrifts, os dnylight ended,
Wild pompe of suntet opened on the eye.

When shall l poss again thot gloomy portel

'I'o our throned palaoe 'm the renlms immomnl?

When in her oar by vingdd drogone borne,

Pale Oeneo sought me through the shndderlng night,
With mgry torohes ond fieroe eyes ferlot-n,

Slnying the dork thet soreened me from her sight,
Idke ι red lionees that rende the nir
Of midnight with her perilouo despair,

Jove, pitying the great passion ot her voe,

Gtve' book the queen-bride to the mother’o grief-
'l'o Ceret gave-through summer'n golden glow

And ι11 the oreeoent month’s from speon to nhenf ;
Alos, how eadly in Sicilinn bovem
1 poss this tonely, lingering time of donem !

In the long silenoe of the languid noons,

When nll the pmting birds m faint with hott,
1 wonder lonely by the blue lngoone

To henr their h'ght voves rippling nt my feet
Through the deod enlm, and oount the lingering time
Bytho slow pulses ot their eilver chime

1 hnguish for the late autumnnl ohowers,
The oool, oool plmhing of the autumn rein,

The nhimmering hoen-froet nnd fmtfnding dovere
Thotgivemebeoktothydorkronlmtgtin3

1 hove no notive land from thee opert,

And my high heaven of heavene ie in thy heeft
