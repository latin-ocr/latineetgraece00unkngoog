ticular was regarded as calling for awastc of breath. The an-

ter, were sung at the meals, aud the practice was in all probability
kept up through the later times.

The study of rhetoric, as has been said, did not gain any
ground in Italy, or, rather, among the Romans, until after the
subjection of Lower Italy. Greek rhetoricians came to Rome,
either at personal invitation, or because of the opening that they
faucied they saw for themselves at the capital of the natiou. The
increasing power and demand they gained gradually led up to the
demand for teachiug rhetoric in Latin. There was strong oppo-
sition, but the opposition gradually gave way. The power of
Greek may be slightly judged by the complaint of Quintilian
(aiter the fashion of complaints heard in our schools today)
that children were taught Greek before they knew their parent
tangue. The knowledge of Greek, while common among a eer-
taiu class, never became widely spread.

RES.

Res occurs in seven books of Caesar 375 times, in Nepos
284. (For its mauifold use, see Lexicou3 also see Nagelsbach,

Roman fondness for the simple is the use of res, ratio, etc, with
such mauifold shades of meaning. Rea is a blank check, so ιο .

the mistake of translating“ case'' hysarae, “ functiou,'‘ bysanc- ·

tio ; “ respect,” byrespectas ,· “ action,'' by actio ,¹ “ history,” by
historia, etc. Rothfuchs gives the following rules:

1. An adjective used substantively always has res if thc neu·
ter form can not be distinguished from the masculine3 there-
fore, not praeteritorum memor, but reram praemicarent memor.

’ 2. This circumlocution with rea often occurs with the expres·

sions ‘⁴ some(thing),” “ n0(thing),'’ “ this,'' “ that,’' “ therefore,”
