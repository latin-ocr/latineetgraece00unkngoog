LATlNE. 17

The boys 01 the second form among you already· know that
Tarquinius Superbus, alter the capture 01 Gabii, directed his at
teution to the arts 01 peace, and, above all, that he built on the
Tarpeias Roclr the Temple 01 Jupiter, which had been vowed by
’ his father. Livy, in this passage (ΜΠ-1111), designates the

whole southwestern part 01 the Capitoline Hill as Rupes Tar-
peiae3 but, in anarrower sense, the rochis asteep precipice to

received her reward 110111 the mooking enemy, and where after-
