LATIN E. 105

Ales ! we who warned thee,'lament thee full sore.
Is this, theu, the eud of thy seoml

One wish was attuiued at the eost of the whole,

But was this the passion supreme of thy soull

Mau lmows not, alas! as the high gods may know,

A schemer3 the true king still wanders elone.'’

Just at the side of the lefthend portal there hasbeen brought
to light a ooueshuped hrioli structure, which evidently served
as a basis for something or other. Probably the Umbilicus, sn

the Roman mile-stoue, which you ruey see in the museum at Wies·
baden. This mile-index, however, was not of stone, but of gilt
bronze, and therefore it beamed forth from its elevated stand-
point over the entire forum. Most likely the distantes of the
principal localities of the empire from the center of the city vvere
marked upon it, so that the center of the empire was represented
by the Umbilicus. Upon the platform erected between these two,
foreign ambessedors, iu, times of the empire, would listen to the
orations addressed to the people from the stage lyiug directly
in front. Yeu must not confound the antique rostra with these.
The former stood on the Comitium, which lay to the north of
