and meaning.’' But this order was little used, except in the mid-
dle story, between the other two.

The Roman Corinthiam—This was really the national style
of the Romans, just as the Doric was the national style of the
Greeks Their model was, of course, the exquisite choragio monu-
ment οἱ Lysicrates in Athens, but they improved and beautified
it, until in the Temple of Vesta at Tivoli‚ and of Jupiter Stator
at Rome, it shines out as almost the perfectiori oi proportion‚
grace, and symmetry. Professor Lewis says that “the Roman
Corinthian, like the Greek orders, consists of three parts-stylo-
bate, column, and entablature; but, unlike them, the stylobate is
much loftior, and is not graduated, except for the purposes of
access to a portico. Its usual height may be taken from two and
a half to three diameters of the column, though in triumphal
arches it amounts sometimes to four and even live diameters.
. . . The column, composed of base, shast, and capital, varies in
height from nine and a half to ten diameters.” As seen in 'the
fine specimen of the Jupiter Stator Temple, the base is elaborate
and rich, the shaft having ¹twenty-four flutings, and the lovely
swelling curve, called “ eutasis,” is as delicately beautiful as it is
tall and slende'r3 while the capital, with its three rows of acan-
thusleaves, its helices, its volutes, and carved abacus, presents
varied and pleasing forms to the eye. Nor is the entablature
less ornate and attractiva. Asplendid specimen of this is afford-
edin the Forum oi Nerva at Rome. The three projecting fas-
cias of the architrave are crovvned with decorated moldings, the
frieze is filled with human figures, the forms and draperies of
which are wondrously beautiful, and the cornice combines in the
happiest manner the 'dentals of the Ionic with the modillions of

the Greek Corinthiam No wonder that the Romans, having per-
iected this order, repeated it with certain variations of proportion
and omamentation everywhere, in their provinces as well as in
Italy. One authority says they had not less than fifty varieties
of the Corinthian.

,Pte Roman Composita is essentially the same as the Corinthi-
an. The volutes ,of tho capital, however, are enlarged to nearly
one fourth of its entire height, and underneath there are only
two rows of acanthus-leaves, nnrelieved by the usual central ten-
drils3 bnt having the egg, dart, and bead omamentation between
