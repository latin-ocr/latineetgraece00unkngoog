If we step down ιο the Via Sacra, at the east of the basilica,
we are buta few paces from the assent to the Temple of Castor
, :and Pollux. The foundation is well preserved, and also a part

of tho mosaic floor of the cella, but only three columns are
standing ou the side, which are now bound together with iron

knightly yonths who, in the light on Lake Regillus, had helped
to gain awonderfnl victory. It was built on this spot because
those Dioscuri had suddenly appeared here aiter that battle, had
announoed 'the victory, and watered their sweating and thirsty
horses in a little pond, the Lake of J utnrna. The temple was so
spacions that often the sessione of the senate were held there, and
the statesmen liked ιο address the people from the steps of the
sanctuary. Caesar especially liked to talk here, and, in remem-

front (of the same) was adorned with beaks of ships captured at
Actium. On the larther side of the square below the Capitol

k At least it is certain, that the Via Sacra went beyond to the cir·
