ΡΗΑΕΤΗΟΝ. [Josephi'ne A. Cass]
“Propositumque premit3 flagi-etque cupidine turmo

Occupat ilie levem juvenali ooqmm currum,
Statque super3 manibusque dotes contingere habenae
Gaudet.” Ovm.
Fling open the glittering gates,
And yoke me the far-flashing steedei
The why-wrought ohariot waite3
Today in the face of the Fetes
I'll win me renown by my deedei '
In spite of the stem-frowning Fatee
I'll win me renown by my deeds!

Make haste i for 1 fain would arise!
The ehargors with hoois of red tire
Stamp fieroely; the swift moment iiieei
Their breath to the breathleos blue skiee
In mist-wreaths of gold doth παρίω
They long to be gone, and their eyes
Are aflame with the eager desire!

Exulting, 1 grasp now the reios,

And forth, like a cry of delight,
They leap into space: what remeinoi
Forgotton are losses and paine;

All’s mine from a mom till a night i
Whate’er be the losses or paine,

Mine, mine, for a mom end a nightl

“ Nee minus Heliades lugent et inania morti
Munere dant lacrymae et oeeeee pectore palmis
Non auditumm misereo Phaethonte quoreln
Nocte dieque vooant‘' Onu..

Ah! fallen and dead and deffledi Nevermore
To rise through the roseo of momi
