But, without regard to the forms and airus of the allegory, the poem of
Allraios, ἄουνέτημι τὸν ἀνέμων στάσιν, necessitates our aceepting the allegory
in the case oi Horace, who imitated or translated Alkaios. Alkaios‘s poem
is an allegory; therefore- Ι

Now, the fact of our ode being an imitation or a translation has been just.
aa inaccurately observed, and as rashly asserted, as in the case of Horaoe'a
Vides ut alta. The situation oi the speaker, and hia relation to the ship, the
form end style of the representation, the immediate condition oi the ship-
oonaequently, everything which oounts iu the end-is entirely different as re·-
gards the two poete. And, further, that Allrnios's poem is an allegory is,
indeed-the opinion of vthe soealled Herakleides Pontikes, in his Homerie
allegories3 but this opinion has just as much, or as little, warrant as the ex-
planation oi an Hemerie myth hy the same roucher. lt is only our fondness,
in aeeordauee with the spirit of the times, ior historieal explanatione that
cherishes end eountenauoes such errors nowadays oi those ancient allegari--
cal expoundera Our ode, therefore, is no imitation oi Alisios, and the poem
of Alkaios ia hardly au allegory, and so, ior the sake oi Alkaios, Horace need
not be allegorical.

But Quintilian says the Horatian ode is allegorieal l do not doubt that
it appeared allegorical to him and many oi his contemporaries. There oer-
tainly was a tradition of the poet's having received the inspiration for this ede
through circumstances or events iu the Roman state, and through meuacing
civil wars3 end this tradition existed certainly not without reason Now,
when Quintilian could not make anything else of this tradition than that the
ship signified the state, the hillows the civil war, and the harbor concord, ef
course, ιο him the ode was nothing but an allegory. In this way, you know,
many beautiful poems in German literature are explained allegorically by
highly edueated critica, because ιο them they are nothing better, and because·
somewhere the “ historieal '¹ information has been beaten up of the “actual‘’
circumstances which lie at the foundation of the poems.

Very well. Alkaios and Quintilian do not eompel us to au allegerieal oon-
ception, but, it is said, the lyrical style oi Horace himself compels us to seelr
another sense behind the literal sense; ior a ship with brolren mast, torn
sails, etc, is in itself no subject ior Horatian lyrica. Now,is some spring or
other, with pure oold water, which readily quenches the thirat of a plowman's
oxen, a projeeting rock over which the water flowa, besides shady trae-is-
this, than, in ιἰιεὶ]Λ a fit subiect for Horatian lyrica? And yet the ode to the.¹
