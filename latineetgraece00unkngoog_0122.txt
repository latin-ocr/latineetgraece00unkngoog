lt was the duty, according ιο Pliny, of the father ιο take the
place of the teacher to his son, but most fathers were content, as
they are and ought to be largcly teday, that their work should
be done by proxy, and so they obtained an educated slave. This
slave, however, did not teach ιο any great extent, but conducted
his charges ιο and from their schoola These school-rooms were
furnished in a simple and plain manner. Th0se of the poorest
character had benches for the pupils, while the instructor sat,
crowned with his dignity, upon a chair. ln some cases, always
when possible, globes and blochs and cubes were used in geome-
try, and it was an extra pisce of luxury if the walls were adorned
with grsmmatical charta. This was as Rome came toward her
later and last days, and, ashes been said, in the time of Trajan,
the military movsments of the army were often imitated in the
schools The private instruction of the Greelr rhetoricians-for
their work at first was confined ιο private families-gradually
spread, and many of the schools at Rome became great private
ventures, in which fortunas were frequently made. Sometimes
the cities took charge of the schoels, arranged for the worlr, and,
paid the teaehers. According ιο the best authorities I can find,
the growth of Roman schools can be plainly divided and clearly
traced ιο and through three periods of growth: the individual
instruction; theu the individual city ormnnicipal instruction; and,
thirdly, the instruction over which the Roman Gosernment took
charge, or state instruction. This last stage was only reached,
however, when the barbarians destroyed the Western Empire.
During tho time of Augustus and Tiberius, education was prac-
tically in the first stage Ihave mentioned

It was frequently the case that a teacher ol promise was
taken in charge by some great family as a client, and his finan-
cial strength and standing were then assured3 but during these
times the Roman teachers were often at extremes, some of them
very wealthy, and others as far at the other extreme. One poor,
pitiable fellow tells us that he followed a balrer's man, who was
carrying some estables with him, for a long distance, tho smell of

“something ιο eat ” arousing his hunger ιο even a greater than
common degree. We wonder what was the fate of the little
lellows over whom he held swayl

The time of Vespasian brought in a new feature in Rome’s
