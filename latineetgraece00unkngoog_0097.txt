LATIN E. 87

sirete understand what the mast and its 'applianees ar‘pnisy, what ismeant
by the cables of the ship ο] atate, with which in the open sea it causet the
violence oi the waves at defiance, etc, provided the listener referred the
opening lines of the ode to the ship of state, and accordingly was carried
forvard allegorically.

Provided: but with what right can we make that suppositioni ln the
illustration given above, the plowman, as a matter of course, from the very
beginning, could have been none other than Odysaeus, because Odysseus only
was spoken of. Scin Theognis, every one knewa from the first word of the
sea-voyage that it is allegorical, and represents the course of the civil eom-
motions, for in the preceding verses, as well aa in the principal clause of the
allegorical sentence, political affairs are under discussion. But in Horace
the very first word of an independent poem is “0 ship.” How does the
hearer, even Horace’s nearest friend, so far aa Ι am concerned, know that by
ship is meant the state i Only a few peges before there is an ode of Horace
beginning, ‘⁴ So may the heavenly goddess of Kypros guide thee, my ship!”
there the hearers or readers are to understand by ship only a ship. Pre-
eisely so here. But assuming also that at the time this ode was written it
was customary to understand such words as ship and voyage allegerieally-
thetis to say, metaphorically-it would be so much the more hazardeus, since
Horace more frequently uses the metaphora ship and voyage of quite other
things than of state affairs, and so one reader might understand this, an-
other that, and even the same render different things in succession. But in
this way the allegory would be turned inte an enigma or common puzzle;
and yet a good enigma can in the end have only one sense. lt belongs to
the unity of the allegerical form that the relations of the allegory shall
be given from the very beginning, either through a coherence of preceding
literal thoughts, or by explicit mention of the literal thing. An example of
the first kind is given by Theognis in the allegory already mentioned of the
ship of state3 of the second, in Gelbel's “Der schnelktc Reiter ist der Tod.'‘
Otherwise we shall have a disorderly mixture of enigmatical forms.
¹ 'ibe objection may be made that thia ode iu fact was intended to be an
allegorical-lyrical riddle, and that at first, in view of the circumstances eon-
* nected with its origin and publication, it was selvable, and adapted to lyrical
perpessa, a riddle in the sense in which Kbrner calls Schiller'e “Mddclen
aaa der &cariffi a riddle. But such riddles of a lyrieal nature always pre-
pare us beforehand for the perception of the sense, exeiting in us a medita·
tiva irame of mind from the beginning by an intimation ef the enigmatieal,
or by direetly challenging us to think and interpret. 0f tbe one kind we
have Schiller's “ Eia Mddehea achin and wurdoder ’¹3 of the other, Schwab's
’⁴‘Nenne mir die atille &adst Allegorical riddleS, then, like other allegeries,
present only such features of the image as can be translated conclusively, one
and all, into ‘the literal, ei which the two poems just referred te are fair ex-
amples. And, finally, allegerical riddles like those mentioned set forth tbe
features of the image in a calm, clearly arranged, narrative or descriptiva
manner. In this way the hearer's imagination is able to construet the image
