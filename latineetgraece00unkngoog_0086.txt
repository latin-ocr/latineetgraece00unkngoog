his life. It was probably entirely domestic. We do know, how-
ever, that great care was taken in the selection of attendants, lest
the children leam improper words, incorrect speech and expres·
sion, poor pronunciation and enunciation, etc. How well this feet
ure could be imitated todayl Our Catholic friends say that, give
them the first seven years of a child's life, and they care not who
has the rest of it. And while this is, of course, an extreme, does
it not show us howimportent the care of the early years, and
how well the Romans did to guard well the opening life of the
Roman boyl

Following these ceremonies, the life of the child, we can imag-
ine, flowed on as does that of the children of other times. But,
when the age of seven had been reached, a marked point had been
attained in the child's life. Then his education was to begin.

The curriculum, or course of study, embraced the following
subjecta, which we wish to touch upon briefly in detail:

Grammar, dialectic, rhetoric, music, arithmetic. geometry,
astronomy. These were really divided, although not with the
same sense aa is our higher educational work, into preparatory
and collegiata-the first three forming the triviam and last four
the quadrivium. Ι would not be understood as claiming that at
all times in the history ol Rome was this course in vogue, but in
no cases did it exceed what was included in this list.

The elementary schools, which the boys first attended, were
something after the manner, although not the plan, of the modern

. kindergarten. The toachera were called ludimagistri, although

this name was afterward changed to grammatiates or literatorea.
There were not the stiff, formal ways which were prevalent in the
more advanced schools, nor in all probability the same strict dis·
cipline, for the rod played no arnall part in the correct training
of the boy. In these elementary schools the children learned
their letters, and then to read and spell. The Greeks built up
their knowledge by beginning with the letters and then combin-
ing them. The Romans, however, worked more on the syllabic
method in vogue today. They learned the whole before they
analyzed. This method met with opposition then as it does
now. In the schools were wax tahlcts with grooves in them, and,
by following the marks, the boy learned to make the figures and
trace the letters for himself. Often the teacher would hold hia
