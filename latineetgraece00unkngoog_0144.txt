134 LATINE.

fortunatcly, to a great extent, passed away. This method of
studying literature for the sake of grammar is giving way to the
disposition to study thinys, not instead of words, but in con-
nection with words; to regat-d grammar as a science having to
do with the expression of thought3 to regard language as a ve·
hicle of ideas3 and, ultimately, to regard literature as the product

 

and index of civilization. The tendency thus to look through
literature to the substance of national life has inclined all ‘⁴ clas-
sical ’' teachers who are alive to spend a part of their time in
directing the minds of their pupils to the social, political, and
legal institutions of ancient peoples, and to suggest the connec-
tion between these institutions and those existing in modern
times, It is thus possible to see that there is a Greek and a
Roman element in modern life that every intelligent student of
these languages should understand and appreciate.

Such considerations have led certain teachers of Latin to em-v
phasize the study of the various phases of Roman society and
institutione, and, as prominent among these, if not the most im-
portant, the Roman law. The reading of a part of the “Insti-
tutes ” of J ustinian or of Gaius has been, in some placeS, intro--
duced as a part of the Latin course. This has not necessarily
been attended by any minute study of the details of the law3 but
it has been sufficient to set forth the character of the legal lan--
guage and the main outlines of the legal system. It seems cer-
tainly true that, if the Latin literature is worthy of a place at all
in our modern education, its study should comprehend those dis-
tinctive forms of thought which made Rome what she really was,-
