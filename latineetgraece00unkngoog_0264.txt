N owadays every man has two vocabularies that he calls his own,
his speaking and his reading vocabulary, the latter being far the
larger. There are many words with which he is familiar enough
if he sees thern, and which he might himself use in writing, which
he would never think of using in speech. Many words aman
pronounces‚ though he has never heard them and only seen them.
A disputed point iu pronunciation is settled, not by trying to re·
call how one has heard the word pronounced, but by reference ιο
a fixcd norm. But this must not be preased too lar. Were the
written symbol always and everywhere active, phonetic change
would be at an end, and any investigation of phonetic law would
be idle. The spelling ol a word is never able to arrest all growth,
because this is so gradual that it is unobserved, and alter the
change has taken place we wake up to the knowledge ol the fact
that the spelling still current represents sn older stage ol the lan·
gnage. That is so familiar in English as to need no illustration.
Moreover, the ordinary speaker does not analyae a word He
does not think ol cach letter when he sees aword any more than
he thinks ol each soundelement when he hears one. Many
people really think that they speak as they write, and would
hesitate to believe that yle is silent in ought, or that there is no y
in ring, and only atrained ear will recognize the difference be·
tween thei in fla and fly. Even those who have studied this
matter sometimes can hardly be brought to see that our English
so-called long vowels are mostly diphthongs—i. e.‚ ὀ in open pro
nounced with a short a after the ο, etc A sentence written with
phonetic exactness is a puzzle that takes some momente to solve.
What the written word really does is to cause exceptions here
and there3 to obliterate here and there a change that has taken
place, and bring a sound back ιο a symbol: to give many words
a double pronunciationem the natural resultes physical and
mechanical causes, the other more nearly like the older pro-
nunciation represented in the script.

Another disturbing force closely allied with the above, and
needing only a brief mention, is the effect of modern education.
