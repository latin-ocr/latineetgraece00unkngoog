ences partly of a palpably poetic and partly of a formally poetic kind, lile the
numerous metaphors.

Thereicre the unworthi'ness of the subject-matter, also, does not compel
us ιο accept an allegorica] interpretation. Or is, perchanoe‚ Goethe's beauti-
ful ‘¹ Seefahrt ’¹ an allegem, since, on the one side, events in Weimar, which
in reality had absolutely nothing tc do with thesea and ships, gare the poet
the foundation for the poem3 and since, on the other hand, a sea-voyage in
itself is not a subject for lyric art t

Isuppose occurrences of political life made the poet capable oi feeling
the universal interest of his time lor ship and sea, at this particular moment,
in a livelier and profounderway‚ and oi making his sympathy ior a stmggling
ship a seasonable poetical expression of his tear belore new conflicta of des-
tiny. And 1 may suppose this, in view oi that ancient tradition, according to
which the ode is said to relate to the dangcra ol the civil war to the Roman
state Tne dread of anea civil war, for example, after the close oi the Sicil-
iun war, might very easily have found ita ideal or symbolical hnage in this
ode The extemal impulse, namely‚ the idea of a struggling ehip appearing
to the poet, might have been¹ given by the occidental sight oi a ship bovering
in similar danger on some coast3 it might, also, have been an incidental sug-
gestion from the ode of Alkaios The thought oi naval warfare, such as the
Sicilian war had been, and the battle at Actium was to be, might have awak-
ened the rememhrance oi former transactione experienoed at eea

fortunately explained allegoricam, instead oi symbolically. May this essay
on Horatian allegory be a contribution ιο n psychologically morc correct and
aesthetically more fruitful conception ol poetic productionsl
