LATINE. 141

voras avo eamr.

In the Latin language there rules the striving after a con·
crete conception, on the other hand, a lach ol abstractncss, which, ·
however, it supplies in such various ways that enough ol clear-
ness and perspicuity is supplied The lach of abstractuess shows
itself (a) in the small number ol substantivas and the weolth of
verb forms. Substantiam, indeed, are abstractione already com·
pleted ; while, on the other hand, verbs marlr a contemplation
out of which alona an abstract expression ol the universal can be
made. (t) Moreover, there is a lach of abstract adjectivae, as
there are only a few adjectivae which arc to be used for substan·
tives, as sapim, amicus, familiaris. (c) 'l'he langnage also fails
in aptness for forming compounds ·

Latin developcd as a languago for the people and in public
business serve'd a cautious statesmanship, and gained its com-
plete perfectiori in intelligent prosa: hence it was far removed
from the play with partly obscure conceptione—from the varia·
ble and uncertain. With this clearncss of thought was united
clearness of expression ’

Peculiar to it is a temperate and measured» step (oratio com-
posita). Seneca says of the orator, “Habeat vires magam, mode·
ratas tamen: mannis sit anda, aaa ensal

Since the Latin language had gained its perfection through
actual uae as a spoken langnage before it was applied to vriting,
it retained an oratorical character. Aa speech which was de-
signed for the h'earer, it allowed ιο number a ruling importance:
the arrangement of the thought, the order ol the words, the
methods of uniting clauses aimed to be easily and accurately
apprehended by the ear3 especially useful for matters of state,
for circumstances ol public life, sor intelligent expression, it bc-
oame a complete organ os sequence-From tle German.

“ Such rules as ‘any noun, not an appositive, qualifying the
‘ meaning of another noun, is put in the genitive‚' or ‘many ad·
jectives take a genitive ιο complete their meaning,’ seem ιο me
injurious to tha beginner. He will be sure ιο give the former
whsnsver he finds a genitive limiting a noun, and the latter
transverse nna a gennae limiting an adjective, and vn rur
to see the genitive idea I can see no difference in the force of
tho genitive in ‘patiam laboris’ and ‘patientta latoris! ’¹ B.
