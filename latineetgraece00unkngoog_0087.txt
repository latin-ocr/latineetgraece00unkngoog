As soon as a fair knowledge of the letters had been gained,
came the learning of words. Passages were chosen which the
boys learned by heart The least slip iu accent or in quantity
brought the correction of the master. Their ears were trained
to a wonderful nicety.

These elementary schools were usually managed by one
teacher, although the having au assistant was common3 but, if
help was needed, it was more common that some exceptioually
bright or advaneed pupil assisted.

Simple arithmetic, or reckoning, followed the reading and
waiting. This, as it was also among the Greeks, was carried ou
iu two ways. One plan was by making signs with the fingere.
Each bend, or each joint, denoted a separate value3 every bend-
ing a distinct number. The skill the deaf and dumb of to·
day gain, and the uimbleuess with which they move their fingere,
show us what cau aud so what could have been done in this work.
The teaeher, from the constant practice of ycarS, would move
his fingere with lightning-like rapidity, and woe be to the unfor-

metio was by the use of aeountingtable and stenes. Oiten this
was done under the form of a gamo. Several Italian games are
prevalent today which are nothing but modified forms or rem-
· nants ol the old school-days ol the little Roman fellows. The
boys gathered about a table3 on the table lines had been drawn,
and a different value attached to each line, so that the value of
the stoue depended upon its position. It was the same prin-
ciple that is employed in the abacus oi today, without which no
primary-sohool is considered complete.

This training usually was completed about the twelfth year.
Up to this time play was uo small factor iu the boy’s life. His
books were carried lor him daily bya slave. This, although a
pleasant manner, for the boy, of getting his books to school, had
one great drawbaek ean the life of any boy be said to be com-
plete who has never had the opportunity of rising in class, aud,
in the full consciousness ethis importance, the envy of his class,
