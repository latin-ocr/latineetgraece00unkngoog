be an allegory of the second degree, like the Horatian, if it uere on the whole·
possible.

The ship is the Roman state. Vcry well; what, theu, is meant by the ‘
mast, sall-yards, and eables? For suppose the bearer bas iu the first lines of
the ode understood the allegory, and consequeutly has recognized under the
figure of the ship the state, under the figure of the billows civil commotious,
under that of the harbor peace and harmouy3 aud tlren be necessarily sees
the hull of the ship of state without a rudder, consequently, so to apsel,
without a state rudder, without the means of moviug aud guidiug itself ou
the sea of politice, and lie sees the mast of the ship of state half broken off,
cousequeutly-yes, what is the mast of the sliip of state? What, therefore,
does the hesrer see in the ship of state? A moment ago, with the tersus
ship, waves, and harbor, the sense was tolerably clear. The metaphora were
otherwise already familiar to the fontasy or could be easily formed oue from
the other for the imaginatiou, and interpretcd hythe understauding. With
stem and rudder the sense would be clear if the power of the imaginatiou
were not too lively aud active, so iu tho case of hull and sails the monning
would be tolerably plain. But mast, yards, and cables—what constituent
parts cf the adure of state, forsooth, is tlre imaginatiou aceustomed ιο see
iu these things? And what is the riddle-solving intellect hastily ιο guess and·
divine-some haste being necessary in the apprehension of poetical state-
ments? Only compare, for example, the nearly related representation of
Theognis v, elil ff. Here, as in the case of every good metaphor, one cau
instantly translate every figurative expression into that which is literal; aud
yet the poet says he has spoken in riddles. But Horace indeed speaks in
insolvahle riddles when lie speaks allegorically.

But we must not in this ode, they say, follow up the allegory in its de-
tails; for in that case it would be a poor allegory, or no allegory at all Per-
haps our expounders confound allegory and simile. Of course, iu the splen·
did simile of the tired and hungry plowman which Homer makes iu his pow-
erful representation of the restless louging of Odysseus for liis Journey home
—there uo hearer needs understand all the individual traits of the simile aa
emblems of particular incidente and occur-rences in the narration of Odys-
seus. Why not? Because the idea ia not couveyed ιο the hearer that the
husbandmen in the whole is Odysseus, aud that his return home at supper·
time is really the hero's return humeto Ithaca Suppose Homer to have said:
“Odysseus sat at the farcwell banquet in the hall of Alkiuobs, and the
minstrel Demodolros sang and played iu his honor. But tlre plowman often
turned his face toward the sun, for he longed for his evening meal. All day
long the two reddish-brown oxen had drawn the plow for him through the
new fallow ground.” Here the plowman would be noue otherthau Odysseua,
and his return home to his‘· eveuing meal nothing else than the return to-
Ithaea-eonsequently an allegory, aud all that follows would undeniably be
allegorical‚ aud the hearer would have ιο excrt himself ιο conjecture what
was meant hythe new fallow ground, what hythe two reddisb-brown oxen,
