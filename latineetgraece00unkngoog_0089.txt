LATINE. 79

So it was that the higher mathematica never gained great
faverat Rome. Geometry and mathematica were valued so long

as they were practical, but no longer. Grammar and rhetoric
were more highly esteemed The musical language os Italy,
which today is the delight of visitors there, which by its melody
and its smoothness charms the ear and inclines a manto believe
that which he hears, was as highly eateerned then as now. The
power oi the orator was recognized and leared or courted by all,
people and rulers alike. Hence, all that tended to train or de-
velop an orator, to enlarge his vision, or give him command of a
wider range of subjects, was regarded aa practical. lt could be
measured by the standard of results.

Grammar was more than the study of technical terma. It
was a wide field, and contained all the elementa of the sciences.
According to Quintilian, it had two parts-the training to speak
accurately, and the critical study of the poets. Now, this criti·
cal study of the poets required a knowledge of the subjecta,
themes, allusione, figures, etc.. used by the writer; and so the

works were standard we find Aesop’s iables popular at all times,
aud, in later days, the same authors that engage the attention
and much of the time of the school-boy and collegian alike were
used. Orthography and the rules of grammar were frequently
dictated3 and, indeed, we know that the dictation exercise played
no small part in the school-work. As it is considered the chiny
in many homes today for the boy to learn the Ten Commend-
ments, so in these schools the lawa of the Twelve Tables (the
loyes duodecim tabularum) were learned hy the boys.

It seems strange to us that with the sunny skies, the earth
and air combining in an effect that must have been conducive to

· poetic sentiment and feeling, and with a language excelled by

lew in its musical power and attraction, music should have been
so lightly esteemed. We lrnow that singing must have been
somewhat common, but the use of instrumenta to produce music
in early times was comparatively restricted. The legends of the
songs at the banquet when Aeneas tarried at Dido's table, were
preserved, and the lyrics have been handed down to our genera·
tion.. But the introduction ol musical instrumente, at least many
