inhabitants of the house; there was in it also aguard of soldiers,
rendered necessary on account of the isolated position of the
hill. Some of these also have immortelized their names, at the
same time disclosing tbe lact by tha addition of “peregrinus”
of their belonging to that part of tbe army consisting of for-
eigners. Since these had their chief rendezrous on tbc neighbor-
ing Caelian Hill, it is probable tbst the post in tbe domae Gelo-
tiana consisted of soldiers from that place. There must have
been in tbe Pcedayoyiam, also, servants for the beavy work, and
slaves intrusted with the management of tbe wbole establishment

Itis, consequently, quite a lively picture that is unfolded be-

’ iore our eyes in these deserted chambers In the small, cool

rooms the boys are learning their pensum ; yonder, at tbe en·
trance, soldiers are loitering about, while others arc sitting in the
airy exedre, relating to each other, maltis crem cabis, their various
adventures. During the narration os these tales, probably not
