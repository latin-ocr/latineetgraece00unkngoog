LATIN E. 19

osted to the Virgin Mary. It stands on the very spot where the
Romans, in the fourth century a. c.‚ erected a temple to Juno
Moneta. Why she was ,called Moneta even Cicero could no
longer explain with certainty. She is said on one occasion,
while a pestilence was raging in the city, to have caused her
voice to be heard from the citadel, and by her good advice or
admonition to have relieved the distress of the citizens. Such
storias, however, were only resorted to in order to account in an

· easy way for the name of the goddess, which was already in

existence. Moneta has the same root as moneo and mens, and sig-
nifies the thinking one. Under this name the goddess, no doubt,
was worshiped on this hill in very early times, just as Jupiter Sta-
tor was worshiped on the Palatina—the powerful male divinity
on the one hill, the sagacious female divinity on the other.

This hill was choscn for the citadel because it far overtopped
the southern summit of the Capitoline. Within the fortification
there was, of course, no room for several large temples‚ and yet for
convenience they united, with the Temple of J uno, which was so
securely situated, the arrangements ior stamping money-a cir-
cumstance which has given the word moneta the meaning of
mint. The fact that the augur consulted the gods especially on
this hill, from which there is an extensive view across the Forum
as far as the Caelian Hill, you have already learned from Livy,
where he gives an account (1, 18) of the accession of ,the pious
Numa to the throne. Itis possible that this superacutum was
also a reminiscence of the prehistoric worship on this cit-adel
hill of the queen of heaven.
