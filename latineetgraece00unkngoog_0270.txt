260 LATINEJ.

'“ Thessandrus Sthenelusque daces et diras Ulixes.'’
‘⁴ Custodes lecti Phoenix et dirus Ulisee.’'

As we translate in the iorrner osse, “accursed greed for
gold,’' we ought in the latter ιο render “damued Ulysses.'’ 1
insist that the word here chosen is the only availsble word in
the language for rendering adequately the latin dirus in these
two and similar passages. Ι should not thiulr it worth remark,
ii it did not seem to me apity to allow the brand oi vulgar or
profane associatione ιο banish from good usage an effective and
much-needed word. Of all men who have written English prose
no one has wielded the language with more shill end power than
De Quincey. Hc had an exquisite ear ior the true rhythm oi
prose, and this is the way he writes He has been descrihing the
hideons torment ol one oi his opiumdreams, in which the eyes
of the crocodilo leered upon him, “multiplied into a thousand
repetitions ’': “Iheard gentle voices speaking tome (1 hear every-
thing when Ι am sleeping), sud instantly I swolre: it was broad
noou, aud my children were standing, haud iu hand, at my bed·
side, comete show me their colored shoes, or new frocks, or to
let me see them dressed for going out. 1 protest that so awful
was the transition from the damued crocodilo and the other uu-
ntterable monsters and abortione oi my dreams, to the sight of
innocent humen natures and of infancy, that, in the mighty and
sudden revulsion ol' mind, Ι wept, and could not forbesr it, as 1

κ kissed their feces.''

Quo. The meaning “ for which ” is suggested iu Verg, Ilo.
i, 21, by Keightly, in his edition of the Eclogues and Georgics,
but his suggestion is not supported by any reference to other
passages. “For which '² is, however, the meaning in Aen. ix,
206, a meaning not recognized iu the lexicon. 1f, ss is perhaps
probable, quo was originallya dative and not an ablatire, the
order of the discussion of the word in the lexicon should be
nearly reversed.

Ac. Ido not find sny notice os a peculias but not infre
quent use of cll in the sense cipro: as, ο nae sture. Ιι occurs
twice in a single oration of Cicero ss antithetical to watra:
“ Quemquam pram huie quaestioni eir et watra andedam ser-
tiesimus et oh innocentio elementissimus!'¹

¹ cic. Pro Boeo. Am, 85.
