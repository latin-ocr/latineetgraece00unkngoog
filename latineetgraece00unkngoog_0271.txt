LATIN E. 261

Agaiu: “ Gam quae facitis aar modi rint, nt ea-a cobis coc·

Sententiam ferre. Both under sententia aud ferre the mean-
ing “to vote ” is given to this locutios, but iu the following pas-
sage the meaning is plainly ‘⁴ to hold '¹ (or maintain) au opinion:

“Oomtitaende' autem rant, quistatim amicitia fines et qnasi
termini diligendi ; dequibus trec video sententiaeferri.''¹

I may as well here point out another omission in theonae of
the word ferre. The phrase legem ferre is deliued ‘⁴ to drinefor-
ward ’' or “ move a proposition‚” “to propose a law‚’' etc, aud
by implication this is its only meaning. But, as lhave previ·
ously pointed out, asin Cat. i, 28, legem rogare means “ to enact
a law‚” so iu Pro Archia, 7, does legem ferre mean the same as
legem constituere, “to pass a law.’' W. C. Concae.

FROM ΘΜ) ROME’. Δ Toacher‘s Letter· to his Papus. [adaptare
from the German] [continued]

The great fire in the reign of Nero made fearful havoc iu this
region, the tenth ward of the city, to which the Palatina be

in the Palatium, aud with him three of the most influential men
of Rome—T. Vinius, Ο. Laco, and the freedmau Icelus—whom
the people jestiugly called the emperor’s tutors.

The Emperor Galba was to have been murdered iu his⁸ own
house, and yet Otho feared the watchfuluess of the body-guards3
ao, ou the day ou which he intended with the aid of the dissutis—
fied praetoriana to executa the coep d’ttat, he spread the false
report that the disorders iu the camp were over, and he himself
killed After having thus iuduced the credulous Galba to go
down to the Forum without trustworthy protection, he had him
surprised aud killed Otho himself had affectiouatoly grected
the emperor in the morning, and had then, as Tacitus says, under
the pretence of having, with several experts, to look at a house
offered for sale, hastened away per domum Tiberianam in Veta-
&seminatori milliarium aureum aab aedem Saturni, Sueto
uiua affirma that he made his way through the rear portion of
the Palatium. From a comparisou of these two passages it ie
