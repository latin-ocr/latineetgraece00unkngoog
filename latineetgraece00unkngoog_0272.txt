seen that the palace oi Augustus at that time was still used as
the principal place oi assembly for the senate, and that the
palace of Tiberius was loohed upon rather astho private resi·
denec os the emperor. The first subscription oi Otho was a con·
tribution oi about twenty-live thousand dollars for the comple-
tion ol Nero’s palace, which extended from the Palatiue to the
Esquiline. But the uinety-five days of hia reign did not suffice
to finish this golden palace. The reign ol Vitellius also was too
short for that purpose Vespasian's army entered Rome too
soon. Vitellius, who in his perplexity was entirely dependent
on the caprice of his soldiers, loch no part in the atorming oi the
Capitol, bnt calmly surreyed the exciting contest and the con·

, tioned Although this palace was not of ao gigantic proportione
as that of Nero, it was scarcely inferior to it in splendor.

This is the only palace on the Palatiue whose interior arrange·
ments are still clearly traceable. On the side toward the Forum
. there was a broad stairway, but all traces of thia are lost in the
terraoed ground The vestibule is not a narrow passage like that
in the house of Livia, but a broad landing-place where the stair-
