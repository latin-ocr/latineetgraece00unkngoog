56 LATINE.

NAMES OF GOUNTRIES.

To indicate a land, the Latinist, as is well known, has three
distinct ways: (1) particular names of lauds-e. g.. Gallia, Aqui-
tania, Persis, Belgium, et al.; (2) circumlocutiou through fines,
ager, partes, et eL, with genitive 01 the name of the peoplc, (3)
name 01 the peoplc iu place of 1110101 the laud.

The first aud second ways 010 also characteristic of our lan-
guage3 the third is peculiar to the Latin. Now, as the Roman
made brevity second only to perspicuity iu importsnce, the third
method especially commended itself to him. Had this not been
the case, the historic style would have led to its common use,
for, as a glauce in Caesar and Livy shows, no name for the land
occurs for the majority of names 01 peoplc. In such a case as
, this, in place of the monotonous repetition 01 fines and ager,
they chose in preference thc simple name of the peoplc, and
0110 may note that Caesar uses the second way3 indeed, tol·
-erably often, but still oftener the third. He does this 01011
when he could have used the name of 1110 land Thus, for Bel·
gium he uses oftcner Belgae (Belgium, 1, 12, 2, and 25, 4); 101

Venetia three times Veneti (iii, 1,1; 11, 5; 17, 1) aud only
-oncc Venetici (iii, 9, 9). 011 the contrary, Aquitania much 01101101
111011 Aquitani. Nepos has Persae together with Peraia, Medi to
gether with Medic, Lipares aud Lucani, although the names Li-
yaria and 1000010 010 1101 wanting iu Latin. Besides, the use
01 the name 01 the peoplc is not dependent upon the existence
of such predicates 00 admit a reference to thc people 00 proficisci,
uenire, mittere, exercitum, 11100ον0, collocare, 1110110νο, and similar
ones. It is used even more with those predicates with which a
reference 10 thc people and a translation through “ to,'' “ against,”
·“ among '⁷ the peoplc, must appear forced Nepos writes tollere
aliquem ia lucanis (Henn. 5, 3), confligere in Paraetacis (Eum. 8,
1); and Caesar dividere Gallos alr Aquitanis (B. G. i, 1, 1), ora
relinquitur per Sequanos (B. G. i, 9, 1),Βή0000 oritur 01 Lepon-
1110 (Β. G. 11, 10, 3), navesfacere in Meldis (1, 5, 2).

. Sometimes the thought of the people is entirely shut out—
e. g., Caesar B. G. vi, 33, l: in eae partes, quae 0010010001ιί0-
90111. Ο1101111100000111101010 0 graceful interchange of the three
methods-e g, B. G. iii, 1, 6, 7 ; sol, 2, 33 001, 26, o. With
this idiom, as the above notes indicate, we shall lead our pupils
