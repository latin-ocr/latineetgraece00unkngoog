As I wander about among the ruins of ancient Rome, Ι often
think ol yon, and wish you could once tread the squares and
Ι streete through which have walked the Roman authors whose
works you are studying, and the men of whom they write. The
Latin historiens, oratore, and poeta, who are conducting yon up

the ancient Romans Here the young people ran, wrestled, and
fenced, or played their favorite gamos of ball. As it is the cns·
tom among the better classes in Rome to-day to talre a prome·

ancient Romans, post decisa sepelio, resorted to 'the Campus
Martius. Horace is one ol the more sensible ones3 he goes to
the baths when the heat os the sun becomes too oppressive: “Ast
obi nae sessum sol acrior ire lavatam admonuit, Μία eampum
lusumque triqoaem.‘’ ’
