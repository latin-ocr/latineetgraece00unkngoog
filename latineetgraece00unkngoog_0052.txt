Novv, if we descend from the Capitoline by the nearest way
Ι101110 Forum Romanum, we shall have 00 001 right hand the
present Palazzo del Senatore, ereeted 00 the site 01 the Roman
'Archives or Tabularium. This Tabularium was built after the
plans of Sulla and Catullus, the latter 01 whom had restored the
Temple 01 Jupiter. lt connected both summits 01 the Capitoline.

Silently and gravely the priests are aseending the steps of the
lofty temples; the business-man hastens to the stall 01 the
