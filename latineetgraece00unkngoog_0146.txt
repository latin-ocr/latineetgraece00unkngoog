and its direct infiltration into the canon law3 the support that it
furnished to the power of the mediaeval emperors and popes3 its
cultivation as a science throughout Western Europe since the
twelfth century3 its preservation in the modern civil law on the
Continent of Europe; its incorporation into many portione of
the English law3 its direct and indirect influence upon the juris-
prudence of different States of the American Continent—are suffi-

 

cient to show that a knowledge of the legal history of Europe
and America is impossible without some knowledge of the Ro-
man law. On account of the perpetuity and diffusion of this
system throughout the civilized world, it is not too much to say
that its importance as a constituent factor of civil society is even
greater in modern than it was in ancient times. What has con-
tributed so largely to the growth of civilization ought certainly
to be regarded as a worthy subject of historical study, and hence
as forming an indispensable part of a liberal education.

In view of this historical significance of the Roman law, its
study has already been introduced into a few colleges as acces-
sory to the department of history. And every advance which
is made in the direction of historical study, as a branch of lib-
eral education, must necessarily lead, if the study is pursued in
a scientific manner, to a greater appreciation of the Roman law
as an essential clement in the growth ⁴and organization of Euro-
pean society.

political and legal science has, furthermore, tended to bring this
subject within the range of liberal studies.
