Tun kinship cf the principat European and several of the
Asiatic languages, generally known as the ludoEuropeau faru-
ily, has long been recognized. A glauce at the numerals alone

tween Sanskrit paucae, Zend pascua Greek πέντε, latin quinque,
Gothic fimf, Lithuanian peuki, Keltic cele, would alone suggest
identity of origin, aud the comparison of forma where phonetic
changes hare not been so great puts the matter beyond a
doubt. Compare, for example, Sanskrit claretur, Zeud mutor,
Greek φράτηρ (in derived sense), Latin freter, Gothic drdtltur,
Lithuanien tramete (diminutive), Keltic brdtleir. lt is clear from
these and similar gronps, of which a large number are collected
in all standard works, that there must have been a tium when
the ancestors ol the vadens Indo-European peoples-Indians, “
Persicus, Armenians, Greeks, Latius, Goths and other Ger·
manic tribes, Slavs, and Kelts-spoke one common dialect. But,
though this point is evident, it forms only the fundamental idea
of comparative philology.

Before the development ef the various langnages can be
scientifically traced, the question vve have to answer is, How has
this multiplicity of form arisenl Is it the result of lewa uuiform
in their working, and simple enough to encourage the attempt
to construet eu exact science ef comparative philologyt Or
must we despair of this on soccum of the complexity of the
melding forces and of capriciousness in their operation, and be
content withmere or less ingenious gness·workl

When comparative philology first took rank aa an independ-
ent scieuce, its methods were necessarily very imperfect Bopp

members of the Inde'European gronp of lunguagea, and con·
ceived their relative positione correctly in the main, was a won·
