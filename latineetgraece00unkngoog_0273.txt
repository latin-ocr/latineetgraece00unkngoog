tron ” to greet him and accompanyhim ιο his business in the
Forum, so now the nobles wait at the door ol the Palatium for
admittance on the part ol the dread tyrant. All the events oi the
day have been discussed; the rich material for conversation af-
lorded hy the new plays introduced hythe emperor, has long since
been exhausted3 every whim of the emperor is humored and com·
plied with3 when, finally, the large doors of the reception-hall are
thrown open, and a troop oi servants dressed in white step forth
upon the threshold ιο surrey the waiting crowd. For not every
one is admitted ιο the presence of the emperor. It costs the less
esteemed knight much trouble and many a demrius before he
has surmounted every obstacle. Today he has been fortunate
enough, for the first time, ιο enter these halla He is dnzcled by
the splendor. ltsurpasses all his expectatione. He has scarcely
the conrogato step over the threshold, which consiste ol an im·

with the pillars of Phrygian and Numidiau marble with which
the walls are adorned. The bases, and especially the capitale,
are so elaborately carrad and so rich in their forms that they
appear ιο him much more beautiful than the simple ones of the
ancient temples. Behind the portico, the walls are relieved by
niches from which gods and heroes look down on the actions oi
seeble mortale. But our knight, at present, does not desire ιο
admire Hercules and Bacchus and the rest of the statues; he
wants, abore all, to sechim whom the poets have compared ιο the
father of the gods. Yonder he sits enthroned, opposite the en-
trance, proud and gloomy, on his lotty seat, looking down upon
those approaehing to greet him. Long time had this ambitious
knight ιο possess his soul in patience before the portals of this
hall of the gods were thrown open to him3 and now, instead of
Jupiter, he verily thinks he sees before him the gods ol the
Δ lower world. Timidly he drops his eyes in the presence ol the
angry and suspicions glauce ol Domitian. From the chamber on
the left comes forth the fragrance ol incense which had been
burned yonder on the small altar ιο the genius of the emperor.
Did the tyrsnt in the enjoyment of all these honors have some
conception ol his human weaknessl Was it on that account
