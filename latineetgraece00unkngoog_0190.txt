A oommon proverb frequently quoted is, “'l'he esoeption proves the
rule”; sud it seems universolly assumed thet “proves“ here mesos “estob
lishes'’ or “demonstratos’' lt is perbsps more likely thet “proves ” here
mesos “tate'' or “tries'' ss ln the injunctiom “Prove sll things” [me
proverb in full runs: Exceptio probet regulum lo ossibus non exoeptls.]

'l'he words “nihil tetigit quod non ornnvit” ers perpetusllyollered ss o
supposed quotstionirom Dr. Johnson's epitephmiloldsmith Johnson wrote:

“Qui nullum tere soriheodi genus ·
Nou tetigit,
Nullum quod tetigit non omsvlt”
It hes boenseid thet there issdoubt ss to the proprietyot the word “teti-
git,” ond thst “mugit'’ would hevebeenbetter. ,

lt seems impossible to prevent writers from using “oui bonot” in the
uuolsssioel sense 'l'he oor'reot mesuing is known to be oi this ustum: sup
pose thet s mimo hss beon oommitted3 theu inquire who hus geined hythe
crime-“oui bonot”¹ ior obviously there is s probebility thot the person
benemed vrss tho omminsl 'l'he usual mose implied by the quotation is
this: tht is the good? tho question being spplied to whntever is for the
moment the object oi depreoiotiou. 'l'hose who use the words iuoorreotly
moy, however, shelter themselves under the grest mmo of leibnitz, ior he
tokes them in the populor sense: see his works, volume v, pege 206.

A very fsvodte quotation oondsts of the words ‘⁶ lsudstor temporis
soti ”3 but lt should be remembered thet it seem very doubtful if those words
by themselves would form oorreot Ietin3 the “se puero '' whioh Hortos puts

efter thern ore required-Ex.
