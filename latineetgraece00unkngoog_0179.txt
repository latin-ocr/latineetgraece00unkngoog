LATlNE. 169

lever did any one or wiking, “nemo umquam, nihil um-
· quam‚’' more common than “numquam quisquam, quidquam.''

lio should be translated by “ non‚“ a single notion is negu-
tivcd, for example, e. g., “ amicum non habet‚” he has no friend,
nol “nullum amioum habet.” ’

And not even, “ sc ne— quidem ” or “ et ne·- quidem‚” cot
'“nec— quidem.”

liet ιο say, “ ut non di'oam— ue dicem‘’ means to use no
stronger expression.

Nourishment, “alimentum, pabulum '' (figuratively‚ “inge-
nii”)‚ not “nutrimentum” (lete and poetic). So, ιο nourish,
better “alere‘’ than “nutrire,”- which does not occur till
Livy. ’

Numerone army, “ingene” ‘⁴ maximus exercitus,‘' not “nu-
merosusss' which, in Cicero, is used only in the meaning “rhyth-
mic” (“ numerose oratio ’')‚ tut, in the meaning “numerous'’ is
postolsssicel.
