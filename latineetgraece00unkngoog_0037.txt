The place 01 the study 01 Greek and Latin has also been very comprehen-
sively examined by Dr. William Τ. Har-ris, in an address at the Concord
School of Philosophy, 1879, and before the American Institute of Instruction,
1879 (in annual volume, pp. 91-119).

[“ The study that emancipates our youth,'‘ says Dr. Harris, “ is therefore
that of Latin and Greek . . . What we call a ‘liberal' education, that is to
say, an education which liberates one, must provide for the elimination ” of
defecta of perspectiva, “ by taking us back through the long, silent agas, dur-
ing which our civilization has been growing.”-Pp. 118, 119.]

Professor Charles Carroll Everett, of Cambridge, in his Phi Beta Kappa
address 11 Brown 8111111111,1873,011“11111ςί11111011 in Life and Culture,'’
touched upon this same feature.

li. Ernest Renan, in a paper on classieal teaching, has declared that the

“United States have created a considerable popular instruction, without any
ι serious higher instruction, and will long have to expiate their fault by their
intellectual mediocrity, their vulgarity 01 manners, their superficiei spirit, their
lack of general intelligcnce.''

Compare Renan’s “ Quaslions Contemporains ” (1888), p. 76.

In 1877 Professor Ε. Du Bois-Reymond, 01 the University 01 Berlin, in an
address delivered at Berlin (printed in the α9111111110111111111111111,”1101111111,
1877), protested against the ‘exclusive prominenoe given to soientific studies
in Amerioa, “the chief home 01 utilitarianism.”

In 1879 Professor Bonamy Prioe, of Oxford, in an article in the “Con-
temporary Review ” (March, 1879, XXXIV, 802-811), presented a very forci-
ble discussion ‘⁴ On the Worth of Classical Education”
