From the Forum the square bloolrs of stoue, which project ,
from the embanlrment oi the modern street, can be examiucd to
better advantage. They served as foundation to the speaker's
'platform of the imperial period. This must hare been very
spacioua Augustus not only caused the insignia ol the repub
lican platiorm‚ the ships' beaks of Antium, to ιο attached to the
new one, but he brought here, also, all the marble statues and
decoratious which thc people had erected iu that place to meu

ior ιο them were fastened the rope aud the rows oi boards by
which the place was inclosed during the assemblies.

ln old times the city market had a very different appearance,
being surrounded ou all sides by shabby booths. The butohere
had their shops here, which certainly did not make the ground
cleaner, nor the air purer. N ext door clanlred the coins of the
