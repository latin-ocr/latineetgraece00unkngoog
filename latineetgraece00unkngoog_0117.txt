, Pessing by this small temple, several stains conduct us down

from the Clivus to a row of chambers Both these and those
lying above served as offices for the scribes and towncricrs of the
aediles. Before the latter chambers, anarrow portico surround-
ing a small space attha southern side, sacred ιο the twelve chief
Olympio gods, leads along. Even though the structure of which
those ruins remain is of the latest times, it may still be conclndcd,
from a passage of the second Philippic‚ that already in the days
of Cicero the Curulian aediles had their rooms here. Antonius
had charged the consul, in the year 63, with having the whole

north sidc, the rubbish-hcap reaches even yet to a height of
several matres, and it is only recently that they have begun to
lay bare here the ancient soil. There still repose, in the deep
sleep of the centuries, the most important public buildings of the
Romana Yonder‚ as has already been said, lay the voting-placc
of tho people (the Romans), the Comitium, together with the
City Hall; there stood the speaker’s platform of the republic.
Yonder was built the first court of justice, which was shortly
followedby a second and grander one. Perhaps it will be pos-
sible, at no distant day, to follow out more distinctly the remains
of these inundatione. The houses which are still standing over
