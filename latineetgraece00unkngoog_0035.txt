So early as 1840, Dr. Thomas Amold‚ of Rugby, in a review of previous
criticisms, made a brilliant and effective defense of 010001001 studies.

[“ Although,” he says, ‘⁴ there is not the corne reason now which existed
three or four centuries ago, for the study of Greek and Roman literature, yet
thereisanothernolesssubstantial. Expel Greek and Latin from your schools,
and you confine the viervs of the present generation to themselves aud their
immediate predecessors.”-“ Miscellaneous Works,” p. 348] ’

The career of Dr. Amold himself, as 0 teacher of the classice, was 0 rare
instanoe of the successful communicatiou of intelligent methods oi study.
See Dr. Samuel Eliot's article, “ Thomas Amold as 0 Teacher,” Barnard’s
“American Journal of Education,” March, 18158, IV, 141-181. Ι

lir. De Quincey, in his “ letters toa Young 1100 whose Education has
been neglected ” (letter 111), touches forcihly upon the value oi “ classical”
studies—“Essays in Philosophy,” American edition, pp. til-cl.

[“ It is not for knowledge,” he declares, “that Greek is worth learning,
but for pover.’'-P. 52]

Professor James Piliam, of the University of lidinburgh, in 1885, deliv-
ered at that institution a course of “'I'hree Iectures 00.. ,the Relatire

Utility of Classical instruction.”

“ Edinburgh Reviev ” (October, 1836, LXIV, reprinted in his “ Discussions,”
pp. 328-347).]

In 1836 were published at Oxfcrd a series of discussions under the title
of “The Oxford English Prize Essays,” several of which (those by Hendy,
Ogllric, and Richards) discussed the value of classical studies.

A volume eutitled “Classical Studies,” published in 1848, as the result of
the joint labors cf Dr. Barnss Sears, Professor B. B. Edwards, Professor (after-
ward President) Felton, of Harvard college, comprised translations of note-
rrorthy German discussions of the ralue 01 010001001 studies.

[lt also contained valusble original material “ He who euts himself 011,”
say the editors, ‘¹ from the classice, excludes himself from a world oi delight
ful associations with the best minds.” Referring to 0 degenerate tone to be
noticed in English literature, they remark: ‘⁴ One way by which this acknovl·
cdged eril may be stayed‚ is a return to such books as lliltou‚1)ryden,and
Gowper loved3 to such ss breathed their spirit into the best literature of liug-
land.”-Page xviii]
