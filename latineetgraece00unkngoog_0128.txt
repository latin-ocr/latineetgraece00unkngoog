fountain of Bandusia appears ιο us quite Horatian, and, even to this day,
Horace’s Bandusia is worthyof consideration ιο thousands of people to whom
the historiast, real Bandusiu is entirely a matter of indifference Why? Be
cause Horace did not describe any particular historical fountain, with inci-
dentnl attributes, in itseli. N ay, rather, in his fountain of Bandusia‚ he has
delineated the beautiful, universal, or ideal picture of aspecies of idyllic, rurai
fountain scenery; and this delineation, again, was not with him an end, but
a means. The end or object of a lyric poet is the graceful representation of
a relation of soul, of feeling, as it isexperienced by the poet and the congenial
hearsr. But now, since poet and hearer do not stand in poetical relation of
soul in regard ιο an actual, individual thing, a fountainsoene, for example, as
such, but only in relation to the universal, ideal capacity for the perception
of the thing or event, so Horace has giren expression to that universal, ideal
capacity of perception which an idyllic scene had for him and his time, and
in like manner yet has for us. The poet ever longs for outer and inner re·
pose; the turmoil and excitement of political and court life are ever sources
of weariness ιο him. Bural life is full of charms and interest ιο him and
his associatos, from custorn and experience; the sight of the fountain of Ban-
dusia ever produces a beneficent effect on him, and becomes to his imagina-
tion and his soul the essenos ol repose, of external and intercal peace. And
he expresses his lonm'ng after this peace by a representation of his sympa-
thetic relation ιο this individual rural scene in particular. Thus, the lyric
poet dous not represent things, events, in themselves; and Horace, also, has
not represented the ship, or the incidents of the ship, in itself. The poet
here rather paints an ideal picture of a large number of individual, actual
transactione, different from each other, which he has obserred, and which his
readers and hearers can ever observe-a beautiful, proud ship, which, in a
stormy passage, has been almost beaten into a miserable wrecls, and is like
to fall a prey again ιο the raging sea, even in sight of a sheltering harbor.
The portraiture is only a means and form, the object is the representation of
the emotions which poet and hearer have for the struggling ship. 'l'hesc
emotions, again, do not hold good for any particular ship, nor even for the
mass of ships that suffer such misfortunes, but for the sentimental or suscep·
tire idea, as a combatant full of spirit and courage, but already wormded and
partislly disarmed, turns once more on an overpowering antagonist, although
certain of destruction in a second encounter. Thosc very expressions which
liken the ship ιο a wounded combatant show clearly that the poet contem·
plated the struggling ship with that sympathy and jnst fear with which he
would observe the spectacle of a human contest with superior powers3 and
therefore, also, with an esthetically ideal sort of the same fear and pain with
which he endures real contests with such powers in actual life Is it, now,
unworthy of Horace if his fear of the severe conflicta of life expresses itsell
in his representation of his sympathetic relation tc this particular incident of
life at scal In how lively a manner the sea andita perilcus life came home
tc the feelings and sympathies of Horace's time is shown by the innumerabis
references, in contemporaneous literature, to the sea and navigation-refer-
