LATIN E. 73

inoved from this monument of vietory, on the protense that it-
was too shocking for him to be continually reminded of hia mur-
dcred brother. Trophies were fastened to the right and left of'
the inscription, and above the arch there stood a gilt currus reju-
yz's of brass, seemingly rushing headlong, in triumphant course,
in which was the emperor, crowned by a Victoria Close to the
triumpha] chariot strode Caracalla and Geta, whom their father
had permitted to share alike the glory of the house. At the cor·
