LATINE. 285

to an exhaustive treatment, the editors would have done a great
service to studente and teachers, if they had tried to satisfy very
moderate and reasonable demands, instead of almost ignoring
the subject.

This statement may seem a little too sweeping. ln some
casea we find vowels marked before a mute followed by a liquid,
as illecebra, tenebra ; sometimes the vowel is left unmarked, as
in quamobrem.

Bostram has the first vowel marked, but uo other word of
' that group except rodo aud rosio. As to some' classes of mono·
syllables, it seems to be pretty much a matter of accident whether
the quantity is indicated or not. For example, ad, cum, ia, ia,
qaum, at, bia, etc, are left unmarked3 while ab, ob, qua, vel, va,
. aad, ter, eto, are treated with more consideration, Actual errors
iu quantity-marksare probably few in number. Cethegus is writ·
ten Cethegus aud repente, repente ,· epistola is found in one place,
aud epistola in another.

Marks of quantity are always omitted, so far as Ι have no·
· ticed, in the case of words inclosed iu square brackets, as those
from which others are derived. This is oftcu a real inconven-
ience to the student. Suppose, for example, Ι open the diction·
ary at the word crastinas. The a is not marked, and l can not
at once infer its quantity from the primitive crac, for that also
is unmarked here. Ι must turn to the article where cras is sepa·
rately treated. There are, of course, a great many similar cases.

Attentiou is very properly called to the usual position of cer-
tain partiales, as tantan, vero, qaoque, ipitar. But in other cases,
where there seems to be equal reason for remark, nothing is said 3
· as, for example, quidem, etiam, ceram, and erpo, as contrasted with
vero aud ἐρίων.

Jam. The force of this word seems to have been mistaken ’

iu the following sentence: At si boc idem duic adulescenti opti·
mo P. Sestio dicissent, jam milri consuli renatas vim et aranas
intulisset (Cic. in Cat. i, 8, tl). The passage is cited as an illus· ,
tration of the use oi jam “ iu a conclusion to emphasize its rela-
tion to the condition.’' But jam is uot here a synonym of pro·
secto, modifyiug the verb, but throws emphasis upon milri, and is
equivalent to etiam, even on me, the consul. Itis correctly ex-
plained iu Benecke’s note: “ Selbst meine Wi'rrde als Consul,
