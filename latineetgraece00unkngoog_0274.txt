As is well known, a chief duty oi the Vestsl Virgine was the gsurding
of the sacred lire from extinction Extincticn οι this lire wss considered as
the most iearful ol sll prodigies, portending, indeed, the extinction οι the
state. Nor was it a prodigy without meaning oi much signifieance for the
oliending Vestsl herself. What it portended for her was a scourging by the
Pontifex Maximus—in the darlr, and with a acreen interpcsed-while upon
the same high functionary devolved the duty oi rekindling the lire by the
friction of two pisces oi wood irum a ‘⁸ felix arbor.'‘ 'l'he custody οι the
sacred lire was, however, not the only, although the most solernn und momen-
tous, oi the Vestals' offiees. 'l'hey had, at stated intervsls, to serve the shrine
οι their goddess, snd to purity it every morning with the lustral water.
'l'hey took a prominent part st sll the great publio nites—such ss the festival
οι the Bona Des, and the consecutiones the temples. 'ibey were invited
ιο priestly banquets, and were present, we sre told, at the solemn sppesl to
the gods made by Cicero during the conspiracy of Cutiliae. Next in dignity,
however, to their guardianship of the ever-burning flame, was their care oi Ι
that mysterious sacred relic-whether Palladium, or the veritable Samothra·

which reposed in the sacred Adytum or Holyof Holies, whereto no one but
the Virgins and the Pontifex iluimus might dare ιο penetrate.

Nothing is stranger and, ss it might at first sight appear, more elien ιο
the spirit οι the ancient religion than the soeisl and politieal status which
was enjoyed by the Vestal Virgins In the pressilingly bright und ebeerful
cultus which Rome had inherited from s yet older world of paganism, there
seems hardly room ior a priestly caste st once so powerful in its attributes,
so aesthetic in its practices, und so rigid in the obligatior of its vows ss was
thstoi this religious community. In the status of the Roman Vestsl we
lind not only a prefigurement of the«“religieuse” οι western Catholicism,
but traces also of the mysterious ane und reverende attaching ιο the Oriental
saint. She was not only a “devote’' held bound by her vows to perpetual
chastity, and liable upon bresch οι them ιο the swful punishment of living
burisl, but she was also herself a sharer, and ιο no smsll extent, in the popu·
lar homage rendered ιο the goddess whom she med. Even her emthly
sacrifices were requited ιο her by maintenanoe st the public eust, and by a
