Septimius Severus was very fond of building. We are iu·
formed by his biographer, Spartianus, that, in addition to his

new buildings, he restored all the publio buildings of Rome that
had been damaged Hie palace he is said ιο have located ou
this side of the Palatine, not only for convenience of resideuce,
but also for the purpose of showing his countrymen, who might
approach the city by the Via Appia, how powerful a monarch he

was. And this impression he strengthened still more by the ·

Septizonium, au edifioe of seven storiea, part of which ‘was still

admired by the Romans. The first were introduced into Rome
in 186 by Fulvius Nobilior. The gladiatorial contestu were bet
ter suited to the rude testes of the time But the more Greek
culture found its way into Rome, and the oftener Roman youths
went to Graece and visited the Palaestra, the more athletic sporta
came into vogue. At first they were held in temporary race-
oourses or in the Circus. Domitian first established a stoue sta·
dium in the Campus Martiae, which had a capacity of about
thirty thousand. This one on the Palatine appears also to date
from the reign of Domitian, and, when we consider his passion·
ate fondness for shows of every lrind, it is not surprising that he
should have built himself another near his palace ou the Palatine.
