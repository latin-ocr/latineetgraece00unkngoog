Maecenas, sprung from kinga ol old, Ἴ
My patron and my aweet delightl
Some in the racc-course have their joy
To gether np Olympio duat:

The palm of honor and the gonl
Avoided by the ardent wheel ι

Life them cn high among the goda,
Amongythe rulers of the carth.

This man rejcices if the mcb,

The turbulent, fickle populace,

Are mad ιο give him acvereign power3
This other loves ιο shore away

In treasure-houses of his own

The gains awept up from Libyan sanda
He who delights ιο plow hia fields

By all the wealth of Attalus

Oould ηοι be moved ιο trust his life
In prriac craft, a mariner

Afraid cf the Myrtoan Sea

The merchant, trembling at the winde,
Which wreatle with the Icarian waves,
Yearne for the leiaurc of hie home,
The green fields oi hia native tcwn3
But soon refita hie ahaken ships,
Untaught apocr man's lot ιο bear.
Some scorn not cupa of Masaic wine,

· Nor shame ιο rest the livelong day
With limbc full stretched beneath the ahadc,
Or where fresh founlaina genlly spring.
In campa full many find delight—

The ringing trumpet and the ahoule

Of captains calling men ιο war, -

By matrone heled and abhorred.

The hunteman, thoughtleaa oi hia bride,
