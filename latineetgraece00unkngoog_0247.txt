Ouu road now leads us up to the summit of the Palatine,
where, as has been already stated, there was formerly a valley.
Domitian, no longer satisfied with the old palace, wished ιο pre-
pare himself a site for a new one, and so filled up the hollow be
twccn the two hills, thus obtaining a large level surface for his
palacc, the private houses being torn down and used as founda-
tions for the new building. Several of these old subterraneau
walls, with traces of their former adomment, may still be seen.
Aportion of the palaco of Augustus also was destroyed at that
time, for here, aud a little to one side where the French nunnery
hasbeen erected, must have been the site of the first imperial
residence.

The house of Augustus‘s parents was on the Palatine, but the
exact locality, which was known by the name of “Ad capia
babula,” is unknown to us Before his accession to the throne,
Augustus lived in the Forum, in a house which he had purchased

from the orator Hortensius Suetonius tells us that it was every Ἰ

modest dwelling, having only short colonnades, and rooms un·
adorned either with marble or artistic mosaice. This simplicity
exactly suited the new occupant. For more than forty years he
remained in Rome, both summer and winter, although the cli·
mate during the cooler season did notat all agree with him
Yet, in the midst of his own comfort and convenience, the em·
pcror did not forget his obligatior to the other officere of the
government, and accordingly we find that he purchased several
of the neighboring houses, aud united them with his own. Be
sides this, he built a magnificent temple to Apollo on that por-
tion of his property whcre a building had been destroyed by
lightning. At the'same time, also, he established a Greek and a
Latin library. On becoming pontifex mmor, he converted his
house into state property, that he might remain here as high·
pricst, since he was unwilling to move down into the residence
set apart for tha pontifex in the Via Sacra. It was his object to
turn the attention of the people away from the Forum of the
Republic ιο the Palatine Hill. The outline of his house was
traced from the foundation-walls, which were discovered during
the restoration of the French nunncry. But from the drawings
