have 001 the space 10 00101 into the details 01 the training, bnt
it was long and careful. We 0011 101111 00100 11100 01 minuteness
when we remember that the schools 010101010 were divided
sharply and bitterly 011 the¹ point 00 10 whether it was right 101
0 speaker, in 0 moment 01 great 0110110ωο01, 10 stamp his 1001 or
10 10111010 quiet 01111 calm. The slightest variation 110111 the rule
in accent 01 slip in quantity was known and noted not only by
the 0111100, but by the 0111110000 that greeted 1110 Roman orator,
and often hissed him 11010 the stage 1011110 mistakes. We can
wonder, then, the more at the grace and polish, and, above all, the
naturalness‚ in spite 01 the arbitrary rules, 01 the great 010101,

In the 10101 days, there 001110 to be the same relation between

Rome and Athens that exista to·day between England 0011111001-
100 and Germany. The young American, who wishes 10 perfect

I wish now, in conclusion, to brielly outline the growth 01
the schools. This training 01 which we have been speaking was
largely confined to the higher classes

Little is now known 01 the educational 01101010001001 the

common, from the inscriptions found in nearly all the unearthed
homes 01 Pompeii which could not have been done by artists,
and from 1110 1001 that 11001101010111001111111010111111011 on

As we have 00111, the training 01 the Roman boys 01 first was
a domestic affair. Each father trained his son, 01111 this con-

' something 01 the feeling today felt by certain people toward

publia schools. It was in 92 0. 0. (662 a 0. 0.) that the magis·
