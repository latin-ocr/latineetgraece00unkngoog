sentation certainly is, for 10 all its relations it appears rhythmically touched,
aad 11 draws us involuntarily into its symmetrical movemcnt. But how can
we give ourselves 00 10 this rhythmical movement, to this sense of beauty‚ 11
10 view of aa 01100ον1001 interpretation we must excrt our powers 01 divina-

2. Who was the Roman writer who gave adescription 01 Divitiacus before
the Senate?

3. Has De Sauley's “ Campaigns of Caesar in Gaul ’' been translated into
English?

4. Is it a book that would be of use 10 0 teacher 01 Caesar?

t. Professor Ellis, in his “ Hints on Quantitative Pronunciation 01 Latiu,‘’
says on the subject 01 the study 01 the quantity 01 Latin syllables, “ 'l'his is a
task absurdly difficult for learners, and all Latin books now printed . . .
ought to have the long vowels distinguished by the sign of length.” ls thore
any series 01 Latin tertbooks in which this suggestion is acted upon? ls the
distinction made by Professor Ellis between pitch and arcent observed by any
Latin teachers in this country?

6. What do you consider the best edition 01 Caesar for teachers‘ use?

Professor Suuuwsr:

Duas Sur: Iam so glad to see' the new September number 01 Larius,
that 1 propose to devote 0 portion of this evening to making 001 0 list 01 the
English references used by my Virgil class, thinking that such may possibly
be of 000 10 some of your readers.

Tho “ Side-mgna in Ancient History and Antiquities '' embrace a number
01 the books which I have used with my Caesar and Cicero classes, but 1 am'
sorry that Professor Post did not include “ Ben Hur,'‘¹ by Lew Wallace,a
Jewish-Roman story of the first century, which seems to me admirably fitted
10 fix and deepen a student’s impression 01 the masterful Roman character,
to say nothing of its other points 01 10101001 10 11ιο Latin scholar, as the virid
presentation 01 Roman chariotraces, the painfully graphio picture 01 the
lives 01 the wretched galleyslaveS, who in silence and bondage and despair
svept the proud vessels on 10 victory, and the most truthful representation
01 the attituds 01 conquered provinces toward their Roman rulers. For its
strong pertraiture of Roman character alone the book deserves amentiam

And speaking of books, Ι do 001 remember ever having seen in barrus
any notice 01 Η. W. heston's translation 01 “ The Georgics,“ in which 1 take
the greatest delight, so wonderfully has it caught the ever-varying melody
and fresh spirit 01 the original.

1 wish Laurus might sometimes g'ive us critical articles on selected 1011
