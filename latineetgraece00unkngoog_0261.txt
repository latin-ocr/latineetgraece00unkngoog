LATIN Ε. 251

the future, the older Indo-Europeans·were on their guard against
the workings ol analogy in order ιο serve the grammatical pre·
dilectione of their descendants, and not to make the reconstruc·
tion of the Inchuropean parcnt speech too difficolt for them.
We believe that, aa certain as we are of the fact that our Indo·
European forelathers had need ol' lips, tongue, teeth, etc, just
as we, for the physical productiori of speech-sounds, so certain
may wc also be that the entire psychic aide ol their speech activ-
ity—-the emergcnce of the sound-images, stored up in the memory,
from the state of unconsciousness, and the unfolding ol the
sound-notions into words and sentences—stood in thc same way
and to the same degree under the influence of association of
ideas as it stands today, and must always stand so longas man
is man”

Thus the study of comparative philology has gradually been
changing its method. Phonetic law has risen in dignity until
absolute inviolability in the sense above defined is claimed; a
more definite conception of the nature of other forces not me·
chanical in their working, which cooperate with or oppose these
lawa, hasbeen gained. Thetis, comparative philology, embrac-
ing the comparative stndy of form called etymology, and the
comparative stndy of meaning, to which no distinct name has
been given, has come more and more to be ranked as an exact
scicnce There was a time when the etymologist was regarded
as a sort of grown-up child, building up castles and towers with
words and roots for toys. There was no difficulty in deriving
eloth from κλώθω, in spite of German “Kleid ”3 ἐνιαυτός, a year,
from ἐν and αὐτός, because it comes back to itself. Θεός and deus
were connected as a matter of course3 deve‘l was compared with
Sanskrit denae, a god or spirit latin was derived from Greek,
Greek from Hebrew, etc. Ii an ingenious philologian were given
avocabulary of words from two langnages as iar apart as Chinese
and English, he would have no difficulty in proving conclusirely,
not only their genetic connection, but the direct descent ol
one froin the other-which should be proved to bc the parent
speech being quite· immaterial. But this happy state of things
is long past among langnagestudents Few thinlrers heve any
real doubt of the claims of comparative philology to be a sci·
ence. Against the new school, however, there are many attacks,
