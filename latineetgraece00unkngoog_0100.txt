BOOK NOHOE'S.

Dr. Prasoor’s Tarrsuarrous or Dr Senserunt arn Dr Orrrons are
marked by their clear English-a quality frequently erchanged for Latin-
English in sooalled translations. Little, Brown fs Co, Boston

Brrorrrrr’s Iurrr Gratim shows on every page evidence of the care-
ful scholarship of its revises, W. Gordon licCabe. It is to be regretted that
a general index has not yet been added We hope the publiahers will remedy
this defeot E. H. Butler h Co, Philadelphia

Torumsor‘s Minuit roe rus Srunr or ernr Garnake will prove of
especial velue to studente who are pursuing the study without personal class-

aceuracy in Latin grammar. lt has references tokllen and Greenough, Chasa
and Stuart, and Harkness. Ginn, Heath h Co.

Trruow’s errrr Lsssoss is, it seems to us, one of the most important
works yet written in its results on instruction. 'l'he inductive method is
there applied with remarkable taot and suooess. Every Latin teaoher should
see the book-if only for the impulse to better methods. Ginn, Heath dt Co.

Paeana awo Prnxan's Hero-Boou or errw Wnrrrso abounds in good
directions to the writer. 'l'he exercises are good, but would hare been ren-
dered m'ore practicable, it seems to us, had each exercise, or, at least, the

earlier exeroises, been sccompanied by references to directions. Ginn, Heath
lt Co.

HernBook or errr Sruorrrrs gives, in oondensed form and with oon-
wenient arrangement, the principal synonyma as used by the classic writers.
Derirations are made use of in marking distinctions. Frequent examples
are given. (lautioris are inserted to help the student to write oorrectly. We

. are glad to know that the book hes alreedy been reoommonded for students'
