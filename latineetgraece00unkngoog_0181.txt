LATINE. 171

in case that bore succeeds in getting by the conrthouse unno-
ticed into the Tuscan quarter. Fortunately, just there the enemy
of this deserter meets them, and drags him before the nearest
Ι tribunal. But Horace continues his wallr, and laughs now him·
self orer his misfortune, His gay spirits have returned, and let
him find amends for the lost time by working out some charm-
ing verses,¹ with which he will, at the earliest opportunity, relate
his experience to a gay circle of friends

We were so curicus as to follow the poet, and hare, in con-
sequence, come back to the Temple of Castor. But now he has
suddenly vanished from sight into the crowded Tuscan street
