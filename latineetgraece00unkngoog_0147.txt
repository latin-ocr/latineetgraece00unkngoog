LATINE. 137

The disposition shown in certain quarters to recognize the
general science of law as a means for giving breadth and disci-
pline to the mind, and hence, as a branch of stndy‚ well suited
ιο the purposes of a liberal education, can not be too highly com-
mended. By the “science of law ’² is here meant something
more than the technical knowledge of the professional lawyer.
It includes a knowledge of the broad and fundamental principles
which lie at the basis of all· jurisprudence, whether public or
private, international or municipal. The emphasis which has
been given to the liberal study of law has required a greater
degree of attention ιο be paid ιο the Roman system. This sys-
tem not only shows, in the best possible way, the mode in which
the general principles of justice may be applied to the specific
and complex relations of civil society3 but it also illustrates,
better than any other, the successive stages of a normal legal
growth, In its earlier stages it indicates how the custom of
‘⁴ sels-help,'’x which prevails in barbarous society, comes to be
restrained and supplemented by regular judicia] processes. In ·
its development it shows how the extremely technical processes

 

of the primitive law are broken down ΒΥ the use of “legal fic-
tionS,” and are at first modified and finally superseded ΒΥ more
equitable modes of administering justice. And, in its complete
scientific stage, it sets forth in a clear light those rational prin-

ciples by which the value of every system of positive law must
be finally tested.
