LATINE. 199

sure, that the two court poets, Statius and Martial, who other-

wise could not sufficiently celebrate the splendore of their mas·
tcr's reign, make no mention of a stodiam on the Palatine. Per-
haps they expected us to taho the existence oi one lor granted,
since every wealthy Roman had a place for gymnastics near his
villa, or perhaps Domitian was unable to finish it Yon can yet
see where the straight line was where the athletes began their
race, and the curve (odevddvry) which closed the upper end oi
the course. The seats evidently rose in tiers toward the wells,
but the plan of the stadium itself was entirely changed by later
alterations. The larger part was transformed into an oval space
which certainly was still large enough for gymnastic enerciaco,
while the other part was turned into a pillared court. lt is prob

. able that the whole stadium was arranged rather ior the private

use of the imperial family. The princes took vigorous exercise
in all sorts of gamos, and then refreshed themselves in the shady
corridors of the court, or sought repose in the adjacent halls.
