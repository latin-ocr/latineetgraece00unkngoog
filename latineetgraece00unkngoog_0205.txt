Days of sadness passed forever,
Victor over death He’s come.
Dying, thou didst weep before Him3
Rising gloriouS, now adore Him!
Alleluia!
4.
Lift thy raptured eyes to heaven,
Look at Him who lives again 3
In His face what swcetness given,
Who once suffered mortal pain 1
Now, from wounds like jewels gleaming,

Brightness of new life is streaming.
Alleluia!

5.
Live‚ oh live, blest heir of glory l
He is come, thy soul's true Day3
Let thy heart swell at the story,
How death‘s power is wiped away.
Far removed each cause of sadneSS,

Fill *thy soul with love and gladness!
Alleluia!
