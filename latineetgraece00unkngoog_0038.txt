ln 1880 tbe same 1111 was made prominent in the inaugurai address 11
Dr. 1 W. Hofmann, 111111 University of Barba, revievingtbe results 11111

11 admitting pupils 11111 the RealScbulen. An English translation 11 tbe

In 1883 Professor Edwurd 11 Sili, in an article in the “ Atlantis Monthly”
(February, 1883, LI, 111-119),11111111(1 “Η111)111 Spenoer's 'l'beory 11 Edu-
cation,” very incisively touched upon the salient points 11 111. Spenoer's
theory.

[“ His main proposition is, in a nutsbell,” says Professor Sili, “that
‘sciense’ ought to supersede the classica, the modern languages, history, art,
and literature. . .. It is 11 be hoped,” he elsewhere says, that 111. Spenoer
“will yet revise the treatise, or withdraw it altogether, and substitute a more
mature treatment 11 the subject, whenever he comes to realize that his reso
tion has already gone much too far.’‘—Pp. 111, lta]

Perhaps by none who bave written on this subiect have the teachings 11
Dr. Tbomas Amold, 11 Rugby, been so effectively supplemented aa by his dis·
tinguished son, llatthew Amold

In 1818 in his volume on “ Higher Schools and Universities 11 Germany,‘’
he spoke with considerable reserve. ,

[“1 am inclined 11 think that both sides will, as is natural, have 11 abate
their extreme protensione. 1111 modern spirit tenda to reach a new concep-
111111 tbe aim and 11111111 instruction ; when this conception is fully reached,
11 will put au end to 11111111, and will probably sbow both the burnaniats and
the realists to have been right in their main ideas.”-P. 1111]

In 1882, advancing 11 a more decided declaration, be publisbed in tbe
“ Nineteentb (lentury” (August, 1882,X11, tle-230), a paper on “ Literature
and Science ’³ (originally delivered at the University 11 Cambridge, 11 the Reda
1111111), which be has also delivered during the present winter in several
American cities and towns.

[In this he emphatically assigna to literary studies a preemincnoa over the
natural sciences 111 the development 11 the powers 11 studente. “ letters,”
he says, “ will call out their being at more points 3 will make them live more.”
—P. 2211]

Lord Ooleridge, inhia address at Yale College in the same year (1882),
supplied some suggestive arguments from bis own experiente.

An article in the ‘⁴ Quarterly Review,” J oly, 1883 (under the 1111111 “‘l'he
Study 11 English literature”), touches very forcibly on the advantage 11 a
classical training.

[“ We greatly doubt whether any one [11 the physical scienoes] offers the
possibility 11 so thorough a training 11 the reason and the judgment as is
implied in the mastery 11 a classical language, in all the perfectior 11 its
lorm.”] ' -
