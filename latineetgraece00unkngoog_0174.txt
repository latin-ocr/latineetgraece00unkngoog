Tur writing of Latin not only presupposes s thorough lrnovvl-
edge of the langusge‚ hut also produces it ‘⁴ without this prac-
tice we evidently should not have gained so complete knowledge
of the old Latin, not so much familiarity with its peculiarities,
with the delicate shades of meaning in the words, with the rules
for the position of words and clauses, sud the entire arrange-
ment of the period For only he who writes masters entirely
tha foreign manner of expressing his thoughts; while with pa·

of a good style, and will strive to bring the same into vogue in
thc employment in writing of the mother-tongue. Praetiee in
writiny Latin is c school of clear thinking, ofprece'sion, and ele·

arrangement of the words, in the arrangement of the clause and
period, the Latin has many peculiar properties differing from the
modern langnsges, and which lay a certain constraint, it is true,

upon the writer of Latin, but slso impel him to earnest stndy
sud shsrp inspection. For this resson also‚e1eroises in Latin·
