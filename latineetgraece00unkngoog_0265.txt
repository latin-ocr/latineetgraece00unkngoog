analyzing of language‚ the classilication of words, etc-begets an
nnnatural attitude toward language and language-phenomena.
It is no longer merely a tool, it is an object of study, solicitude,
and perhaps artistic enjoyment This brings about a certain
consciousness in the use of language which interferes in another
way with the mechanical working ol phonetic law.

Another modern invention more recent than printing has
produced results even more important on languagehistory, that
is, the utilization of steam as a metire power. That alone has
rendered possible the restless moving hither and thither of these
days. In the vast extent of soil inhabited by English-speaking
people there is room for thousands of dialects. Dialectic varia-
tions are constantly springing up, but, before these peculiarities
have a chance to crystallize, the population of the place has lost
its local coloring. New elementa from all over the world have
entered. Withont going into detail, it is evident what an im-
portant effect this mixture of incipient dialects must have. A
child learns one word from its father, who is a Neu-Yorher, and
says ndbn for neon, δῶτε for bffits3 another from its mother, a
aVirginian, perhaps, with a well-marked parasitic yeound, c. g.,
in cyur, cyoal, etc.; and a third from the servant, who may be
an Irishwoman or a nagreae. When we further consider the
special professional dialects with which every one is more or less
familiar, Imean the dialects of the pulpit and of the stage, it is
no wonder that normal languege growth is hard for us to realize.

The disturbing influences above enumerated as arising from
the image of the written word, from an artificial attitude toward
lauguage, introducing a conscious clement, the existence of a
fixcd norm to refer to, the mixture of the innumerable incipient
popular dialects, and the dialects of the pulpit, platform, and
stage, may really be reduced to two: first, aset of forces tending
to chain the fleeting sonnd to a fixed form ; and, secondly, a set
of forces dimming the soundimages, by enlarging the latitnde
of the variatione in' the pronunciation of even the most familiar
words. Ι

If, therefore, it be said that it is a necessary consequence,
the theory of phonetic law, that doublets going baclr to one
single form can not be accepted as spontaneous growths ina
single dialect, but must be referred to some ontside force, it would
