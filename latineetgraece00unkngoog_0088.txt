78 LATINE.

At about this age he was turned everto the tender mercies
of the yrammoticus or literatus.

These elementary teachers did not have the privilege or gain
the reputation of those engaged in the higher branches

With the grammatici or literati the study of Greelr was
added to that of Latin. Staudard authors were studied3 selec-
tious were learned ‘¹ by heart,'’ and great attention was given to

etymology and the gaining a clear insight into the meaning of
the author. A common manner was for the teacher to read aloud
to his class first, and then have them read after him, and, as soon
as possible, for each to commit the entire selection to memory.
These teachers prepared the way for the rhetores, aethe
grammaticus had prepared the way for them. “Rhetoric was
to Roman education what music was to Greelr.” Ιι seems ιο
'have been a mingling and nnion of many elementa, imparting
not only discipline, but what we today term “culture ” as well.
We must bear in mind, however, that the Roman was an intense·
·ly practieal man. Nothing was of any value to him unless it
tended direetly ιο further the youth in his ehoseu worlu The
Greek mind delighted in fine distinctions and lreen subtilties,
and we know from the accounts we have of Socrates’s life and
manner of teaching, and of his followers as well,that a general iu·

' terest on certain subjects could bea roused at Athens that among

the Romans would, as a rule, be passed by unnoticed, save perhaps
with contempt They had the genuine element which we claim
today aa a Yanlree trait, of testing the velue of everything‚ and
hardly being williug to wait for results. So it came to pass that
' as the Romans came more iu eontact with the Greeks, as the re·
sult of battle and conquest, some saw at once the velue of Gre
cian culture and arts3 hut among the many a storm was raised
against the impracticahility of such studies as occupied the
mind of the aesthetio Greeks. But Grecian seed was planted
anda union was formed which, though like the cloud of the siae
of a man’s hand, soon spread and produced afruit on Roman
“ soil which it never could have gained among the Greelrs. There
was at Rome, perhaps, less of pure 'culture thau at Athens3 less
of the keen mental shading in regard ιο philosophical 'matters3
· but there was more of a sturdy strength, of solid reliability, less
intense individual selfishness, more results manifest.
