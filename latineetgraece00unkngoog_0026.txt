power, fell into ruins; and then over these ruins in later times new

younger oi you will, no doubt, first hasten toward the bushes on

it is only in thankfnl remembrance of that good-natured she-

At first view, you will all think the Capitol has entirely
changed its ancient form. lt has only assumed a modern garb
in deference to the prevailing taste. The present Capitolino
Squere, which is surrounded on three sides by modern buildings,
and in the center of which stands the antique equestrian statue
oi Marcus Aurelius, has been established only since the sixteenth ,
century. That there was originally a hollow here is still plainly
to be seen, irom the fact that steps lead from the square, right and
leit, to the two summits oi the hill. The southwestern oi these
summits the ancients called Capitolium, and the northeastern
Arx. Between them, on the spot which, in the time oi Livy, was

. still inclosed on account oi its sanctity, Romulus is said to have
opened his Asylum. In this hollow was worshiped already in -
very early times, between two groves, the god Vejovis, who, on
that account, was called Vejovis Luceria And inssmuch as this

epithet sounded something like that of Apollo Lykoreus, the
Italian god was often identified with the Grecian-the more so,
because the former also was represented with the avenging arrow
in his hand. To the sanctuary oi this god the homeless, who
were to people the young city oi Romulus, were allowed to fiee,
to make expiation, and then, purified of all past crime, to enter
the'gate of the Palatine city. Nothing is handed down to ns of
another temple between these hills. Perhaps the awe inspired
hythe stern god Vejovis, who once demanded human blood for
atonement, was so great that they did not venture to hem in his
jurisdiction with other buildings. Besides, it was not easy to
bnild on these slopes, and a temple on one of these two heights
had a iar more beautiful and prominent position.
