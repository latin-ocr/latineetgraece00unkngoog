LATIN E. 239

Having found these, it will commonly be easy ιο find their several modifiers,
whether they be single words or clauses. Look out ior relative clauses, and
remember that a relative clause can not contain the principat idea of the sen·
tence. The same theory is true, with rare exceptions, of verbs in the sub
junctive or infinitive nicode, they must generally depend on something else.
If you meet with a word that seems quite uniamiliar, try and‘find some like-
ness to a known word. See ii it has a prefix, suffix, or both, separate these
from the stem, and thus get at the root oi the word. Never stop in the
middle oi a sentence. 11 the sentence gives you no idea whatever, go baels to
the beginning and read it through again llost studente will be surprised ιο
find that a second or third reading will give them a clear idea of what seemed
at first unintelligible. 'the context will explain a great many difficulties, and,
by a constant repetition ci tlre process outlined above, most of the sentences
· in such an author as Nepos will yield their meaning.

'l'he praetiosos reading at sight vn'll not teach exactness. 'l'his is not its
aim It will, however, produce fluency and confideres, exactness may be
made to follow these, or may be attained by other means at the same time.
One oi the chief advantages of sightreading lies in its ability to mltivate the
judgment rather than the memor-y. Τοο many studente approach every Latin
or Greek sentence as though it were necessary, in order to understand it, to
investigate all the possible meaniugs oi each word, all its grammatical affini-
ties, and all its etymologieul ramifications. This is arr excellent exercise in

· any language, but it is not reading. The proper time to pursue such a study
of languageis aiter, not beiore, the student has become ableto understand

the author’s meaning. Tuouss B. Lrunssv (in Prefcoe to 0. Nepos).
