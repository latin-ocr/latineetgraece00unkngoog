LATIN E. 75

marriage between adopted childreri was stcmly aud strictly for-
bidden. Another fact must be taken into account in dealing
with the elemcuts that entered into the young boy’s lile. The
position of his mother, ol the Roman woman, was lar above that
of other nations of antiquity. In the home (domas) she was the
dornina (mistress).

The position and the dignity of the Roman metron made the
mother’s influence in the education of her children greater than in
any of the snrrounding nations, or, indeed, among any of the na·
tious known to history. Browning says: “ One of the chief char·
acteristics of Roman education was the influence ol the mother.
The Roman wife was the worthy companion of her husband, and
she was often the best stimulus and example to her sons.”

With the dignity and the fear and the love so olten displayed
by tho father, and the respectlul carc and attention of the mother,
the young boy was thrown into life in a different condition than

· that of any of his neighborly brothers—a frcedom, and yet restric-
tion3 with a private as well as a public life to aspira to, and more
of the home influcnce than could reasonably be expected of the
times, he must have gained a view of living never dreamed ol by
others. And this was largely dne to the law or custom that pro

hibited his father from trying the evils of polygamy.
The Germanic nations shared with the Romans the honor of

treating their women in a comparatively dignified manner.

’ Becker's “Gallus ’⁹ records that' the Romans secmed to have

ascertained what learned wives were, what tyrants wealthy ones
were apt to be.

At the birth of the child, the oustom common in Graece and
Rome alike prevailed‚ whereby the father declared whether he
would bring up the child as his own or not. N ine days after the
birth of the boy, and eight after that of the girl, followed the
lustratio, and at the same time they received their name (noman
accipiebant). Small gifts were made at this time, and each suc·
ceeding birthday saw new gilts bestowed

After the lustratio (dies trasericus) there came the formal an-
nouncement in order that the boy’s name might be entered in
the public registers. In those old times, and the same was true
of the Greeks, there were no wetnurses, but the mother nursed
the child herself. Only little is known of this early periodos
