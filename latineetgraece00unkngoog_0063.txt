wall-were everywhere regarded as' a legitimate mode of display·
ing a rich and elegant teste.

Composita decaden—But “the true Roman order,'’ as Mr.
Fergusson says, “ was not any of these columnar ordinances, but
an arrangement of two pillars placed at a distance fr‘om one an·
other nearly equal to their own height, aad having a very long
entablature, which, in consequence, required to be supported in
the center by an arch springing from piers. This. . . was,
in fact, merely a screen of· Grecian architecture placed in front
of a construction of Etruscan design.’' At first these arcades,
composed of the three orders superimposed one above the other,
were commonly used, but later, as in Diocletian’s palace at Spala-
tro, the arches were made to spring directly from the top of the
column, while the column itself was placed without a pedestal
upon its foundation. However much the purista may criticise
these arcades, they formed, newerthelesaa noble and singularly
impressive feature in Roman buildings, and were repeated every-
where throughout the empire.

The Βονηαη pedimcat-that is, the triangular form made at

the end of the rool' by the rasters and the horizontal cornice be·
neath-was considerably higher or at a greater angle than in the

Grecian temples. Thc angle was from eighteen to twenty-five
degrees, but this was no improvement, as it seems less well pro-
portioned and pleasing. .

The Roman stereobate-or base from which the cella-wall
rose without columns-was conspicuously different from the Greek
stylobate, which afforded room for one or two rowa of columns
all around the cella, making the peripteral or dipteral temple.
The Roman base was also much higher, and was ascended by an
uneven number of steps, so as to allow one the good luclr of
planting his right ioot on the first step below and again on the
platform above.

To commemorate victories and great names they reared sub-
lime arches and loity columns as the most fitting and conspicuous
oi monuments. The column in honor of Trajan speaks of his
mighty conquesta, and that in the old Forum perpetuates to this
day the memory of the Emperor Phocas3 while the arches of Ti-
tus and Constantine are perpetual reminders of the glory of their
emprre.
