perhaps the most to bring order out oi chaos in comparative ety-

As the new school in Germany, generally called “ Die jung-
grammatische Schule,’' has been steadily gaining influenee in the
philological world, and the theory set forth in this article is
based on their principles, it is necessary to quote a few words
from Professors Ostholi and Brugman, two ο1 the most active
advocates ο1 the new methods In the preface to their “ Mor·
phologische Uutersuchungen'’ they state their position as iol·
lewe:

“ The two most important methodological principles of the
neo-grammarians are the following:

“ First All phonetic change, in so far as it proceeds me-
chanically, is brought about in accordance with laws admitting
no exceptione—i. e., the direction ο1 the change is always the
same with all persons belonging to a community using the same
language, excepting where dialectio variation comes in3 and all
γ words in which the sound, that is subject to the change, appears
under like circumstances, are without exception subject to the

“ Secondly. As it is clear that association ο1 form-i. e., the
creation ο1 new speech-forms by analogy-plays a very important
part in the life of the modern lenguages, so we must unhesitat

not only recognize it, but must use it to explain old forms, just
as ior langnege-phenomena oi later periods. We can not be iu
