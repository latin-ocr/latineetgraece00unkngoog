simply points that have hoen jottcd down as they casunlly caught my aya or
urantcd my attention:

ln the list ol authors und their works prefixed to the lexicon, Sextus Ros

¹ cius Amerinus is oonloundod with Quintus Roscius Comoodus.

Iuda is dalinad only as “ judgc.” Tha vomi certainly mswars in the plu·
rnl very often to our “ jurors.” An intonasting use ol the word occurs in cic
Rosc. Am, 8⁵: Tamen facilc mc paterer ccl illo ipso (sc. Caviclumimo

· Mitt quaerente vel apud cassiano· judices-pro Sa. Roocic dicere. Hera

judica must bc tmnslsmd “judgc‚” and judices “jocosa” If the student
looks undar “Cassianus'’ in tha laexioon, he will lind “of Cassius’' as the

Aliquis occurs as tha exact equivalant of quidam, if 1 understood its
meaning, in tha following passages:

Quod in oo (sc laomim) quani luam olsqnod probitatis ct virtutis perspicere
atomon (lic. da Am„ viii, 27.

Enniam condas appellat poetas, quod quasi dmm aliquo dono donce mu-
*mre commendati uobis mc videantur, Cic Pro Arahtu, viii 18.

or, ‘⁴ if I may say so‚‘’ a meaning which quidm has vary ultan Compara tha
sentence in the Pro Archia pmceding tha ona last quoted above: Poaeam-

mauu mim quoe nostro causo nunquam jaceremus, facimus cocao micantia
De Am.¹ xvi, hl.

Per in composition, it is said, usually adds intanslty to tha signification,
“ thoroughly‚” “completely‚‘’ etc. Very truc, hut what shall wa say of ρπβ
dau? In this word per seems to mean not ⁴⁴ exocodingly,¹¹ nor ‘⁸ through ’'
