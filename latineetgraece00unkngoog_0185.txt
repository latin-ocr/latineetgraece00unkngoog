in which, during the celebration of the

binos⁴ From the top oi the Palatina
down to the Circus there was a stair-
way, called Cacus, probably in honor
of that Cacus who is said to have
stolen Hercules's cattle and driven ‚
them ιο his cave in the Aventino.
We can no longer ascend the steps,
as most of them have been destroyed, ‚¹
and besich, we must not yet leave J]
the southern slope; there are still -f
many things here to be secu, On '1ss
the left appear many traces of private ll
houses, which shows that the Romans ,l
were fond oi living in this neighbor- ι
hood, For it was no small gratifica· T
tion ιο a Roman ιο be able to view the μζ
sporta in the Circus from the roof oi f,
his house. The imperial palaces which
completely occupied the rest of the ll
hill never extended ιο this region. It ι’
seems to me quite natural that impe-
rial freedmen especially should them· ,l

vicinity of tho Palatino, and this also {J
explains how Augustus could look at fs .·
the races in the Circus from the rosi· ‘s

dences of his friends and freedmcn. ἲ
