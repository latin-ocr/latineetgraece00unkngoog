were all of brick. The arch in these and other vast structures
took, wherever it was necessary, the place of the posteand-lintel
system which had been exclusively employed by the Greeks, and
afforded an easy means of roofing broad and lofty spaceS.

Again, the arch, by being expanded into the dome, enabled
the Romans to adopt from the Etruscans the ground—plan of a
circle instead of the rectangular form so uniformly employed by
the Greeks And thus their noble domeS, rising from dmm-like
walle, as exemplified in the Pantheon, became the inspiration of
Brunelleschi‚ Michael Angelo, and other Renaissance builders of
the fifteenth century. It was the proud ambition of Angelo “ to
hang the dome of the Pantheon in the air '²3 and the wonderful
Δ dome of St. Peter‘S, lifted over four hundred feet alost on a drum
supported by arches springing from towering piens, was the out-
growth of the Roman arch.
