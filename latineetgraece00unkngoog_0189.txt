remaining behind, and drawa this neat little picture behind hia
baoln Of all these serawls the well-lmovm caricature of the
Crunified has become the most noted To a orosa drawn hya
few lines is affixed a man with the head of an ass, and, by his
side, asif engaged in prayer, is a horribly deformed man, and
these words: Ἀλεξάμενος villere (σέβεται) θεόν (“Alexamenoa
worships God”). Aa Alexamenos in another inscription ia called
a “fidelia” it is established, beyond a doubt, that thia picture
representsa praying Christian monked by his wielred compan-
iona It was cast in the face of the Jews originally that they
worshiped an ass's head. In the wilderneas they are said to have
followed the wild asses to see where they went to drinlr, and to
have worshiped the ass afterward in the Temple in thanlrfulnesa
for this guidanee. And since the Christiana at first vere regarded
as¹ a sect of the J ewa, they had to endure this senseless reproaeh.
Tertullian, in his defense of Christianity, repels thia imputation
with much force. The ‘⁴ moelr orucifix ’' belongs to the time of
this Chureh father, at the end of the second or beginning of the
third century, and shows that the habitos deriding the Chris-
tiana, which vasso extensive at that time, had penetrated even
into the youthful circle of the Pnedoqoyiom.

Be it for others to fashion the breathing bronzes more nioely,

And ιο plead cases better, better the pathwaya of heaven

llarlr with the vand, and deelare the rising atara and their reasons,
Thou, 0 Roman, remember to mle, in authority, nationa—

'lhese are thy destined arta-and the terma of peaee to establish,

And the submissive to spare, and to humble with warfare the haughty.
