and from one ol the most recent 1 must quote a few words: Pro
fossor Easton, in an article entitled “Analogy and Uniformity,”
published in the “ Amer. J our. of Phil.,” tries to show that nni·'
l'ormity ia an altogether unwarranted dogma, and sums up bis

results as follows: ‘⁴ Suppose that we recognize the fact that the
soience of langnage isnot at all an eraot seience, and that the
comparison of cognate words, particularly, is a process in which .
ic is impossible to avoid essential errora of every description. N o
euduring results are ιο be attained hy attempting to apply nn-
varying law in the investigation of any series ol phenomena
where no experiment, so to speak, can be made under conditione
that cau be controlled or calculated The subject can be treated
only as we treet the history of dress, weapous, and tools in gen-
eral; none of these subjecte lorm a aelfeentered complete soi-

dition of things altogether to be regretted Even the most exact
of all the solennes, mechanica, which is more fortunately circnm-

and that it possessos a well-established body ol fundamental law,
even this seleuce is unable to solve many practical questions of
great complerity: tbe best mathematica] talent of Eogland de

The soundness of this result is vitiated‚ it seems ιο me, by
one fundamental error-via. by ⁴not recognizing that the utter-
ance of the souods of language is normally accensione, and that
true phonetic change is wholly so.

How is it that a philologist, perhaps ewen the majority of
them, men who have made language their chief study, oen have
amis'oouoeption on such every vital pointl How ia it that pho-
netic law and phonetic growth are in the minda os most anoh
vagae notionsl Tho reason lies, I believe, in the fact that there
are so many forces at worlr in modern society which disturb the
normal flow of language-phenomena

Language in its essenoe has one purpose, and only one-via,
to enable one man to communicate with another. That a tone-
language triumphed over all other means of communicationis
due not at all to any inherent naturalness, but merely to its
greater convenience and greater capabilitiea Langnage proper
