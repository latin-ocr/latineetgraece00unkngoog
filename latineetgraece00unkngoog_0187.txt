Caligula regaled himself with the liv'ely sesnes in the valley from
the demus Gelotiana The adjective Gelotiana, derived irem the
name of a former inhabitant, was retained even after the rebuild-
ing of the house, to distingnieh it from the other parts of the pal-

flanked on opposite sides by small rooms. Only those on the·
left, grouped around an ancient ealon or caedra, are preserved.
