88 LATINE.

line after line, and at the same time the understsading can adwanoe without
disturbance and embarrassment to an everclearer perception All oi the
three following characteristica oi aiu allegorioal enigma are wanting in this
ode oi Horace: 'l'here is wanting, in the first place, every intimation of an-
other sense than the literal; secondly, every incitament to reticet and inter-
pret, so that mast, yards, cables, decoratcd stem, do not admit of a solution,
lastly, the representation isso rividly lyrical and dramatic that the hester
has no time lor reflection, and instead of advancing step by step from the
mysterious darkness into the hopelul twilight, and from this into the tull
daylight of perception, he is evermore powerfully urged on into a rividly
lyrical participation or feeling, and drawn into the dmmatic situation oi the
struggling ship as into an actual one-that is, a aon-allegorical one

But, theu, ran the objecta cf au allegory as they are under discussion in
this ode be attained il, as we hare just seen, all the sornu of the allegoryare
wanting? lt is the object cf an allegory, they say, also in this case, to make
what is less clear more conspicuous. 11, nou, as has just been argued, the
rividly dramatic representation causes me more and more to sympathice with
the situation oi the clepa, as it this were the poetically actual situat'mn, can the
situation of the atate by this means become apprehensible to mei It my
sceliuys ior the alrip are ever more and more wiolently aroused, can my con·
templation oi the state become more lively? And it Ι am obliged continu-
ally tu bring to my consciousness the fact that this ship is no ship, and it 1
am suddenly to give that sympathy which I feel ior the struggling ship to
the imperiled state, can the eiiect on me be an undiuidcd one, an comest onel
No, at hest only one rendered sprightly through contradiction, as in the case
oi those allegorical representations in sculpture, where the dmmatic action is
more powerful than is compatible with the aesthctic character of allegorical
transactions.

But may our allegory perhaps serve the purpose oi characteristic inter-
pretation? lletuphors, you know, ought to give us a definite representation
of the particular species oi the individual thing in a better and livelier man-
nerthen any natural mode oi expression whatsoever can gire. Thus, for ex-
ample, the whole carrying out oi rudder, mast, sall-yards, etc, might make
characteristically clear tc us the general idea of the wretched condition and
immediate perilot the ship of state; quite right It we knew from the be-
ginning that in general the ship of stata was meant, we could in a measure
obtain a clear idea oi the peculiur state or condition of the ship of state3
and it it had been stated before that the country was ia a miserable condition
oi defenselessness and threatening danger, like o ship which, aiter the course
ol aformer sturm, was exposed to a second—then, indeed, tha particular
representation oi the defenseless condition of the ship would giwe us a char-
acteristically clear conception ol the condition ol the state. So we should
hare an appropriate allegory, or, again, an appropriate simile, instead oi an
incongruity in pretty verses.

Again: perhaps our allegory serves rather the purpose of the sense ol

beauty than that of characteristic interpretation. Beautiful Horaoe’s repre
