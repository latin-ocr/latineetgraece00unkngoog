Along the whole region which runs parallel with the Vela.-
brum, ancient and modern walls meet our way, which, however,

' awaken no great interest. It is only at the southwestern angle

of the hill that we encounter a remarkable ruin, the remains of·
the oldest wall of Rome. The material for the well-hewn blocks

rescue of the twins, Romulus and Remus. The Tiber near by,
into whose raging floods they were to have ‚been thrown, had
just at that time overflowed its banks and filled the hollows be-
