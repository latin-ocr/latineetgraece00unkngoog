the least surprised if analogica! formatione meet us in the older
and oldest speech-perinde in the same or even greater abuudsnce
than in the more recent and most recent periods. ’

“ . . . To defend our method against some recent attacks, [
must brielly touch on two chief points

“The one is this: Itis only he who holds firmly to phonetic
law, the foundation pillar of our whole seleuce, who in his in-
vestigation has any solid ground under his feet On the other
hand, he who unnecessarily‚ merely to satisfy certain whims. cr
predilections, admits exceptious to the phonetic laws that rule
a dialect; who meumes that isolated words or classes of words
have not been affected hya phonetic change which has demon·
strably affected all other similar forms3 or contrariwise assumes
sporadically, in the case of isolated forms, a phonetic movement
with which all other similar forms are entirely unacquainted3 or

other3 and further sees in all these his darling but unexplained
exceptione nothing abnormal‚ but rather anatural consequence
of mechanic phonetic law, and moreover‚ as happens very fre-
quently, uses these exceptious as a basis for further deductions,
aimed to destroy the universality of the phonetic law, otherwise

lute necessity to subjectivity and caprice He may, indeed, in
such cases offer very ingenious combinations. but noue which
merit confideres, and therefore dare not complain if he meets a
cold and simple negative. That the new school is not yet in
condition to explain all socalled exceptione by phonetic lawa,
can not be made a ground of reproach against its principles.

“And‚ secondly, one brief word more on the utilitation of
the principle of analogy in the investigation of older speech·
periods. Many think that analogical forms appear chiefly in those
periods in which the ‘languagefeeling’ is already ‘degraded,'
or, as they often say, the ‘languageconscionsness' is ‘dimmed’
and therefore that they are not to he expected in the same
abuudance in older periods of language as in younger. A strange
conception-a conception sprung from the same scil as the idea
that language and language-forms live a life of their own, apart
from the speaking individuals. . . . Perhaps, in premonition of
