this, his temple-house, the capital of the world Here the young
Romans offered up sacrifices when they had laid aside the dress of
boyhood; here the consuls entered on the duties of their office,
hither the victorious generals, after having been led in triumph
through the city, directed their steps, ιο express their gratitudo
in the temple of their mighty god And not only mortals sought
here safety and deliverance, but even the celestials, with their
sanctuaries, altars, and chapels, joined themselves closely ιο the
